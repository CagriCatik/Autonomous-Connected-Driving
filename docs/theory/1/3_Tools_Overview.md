# Tools Overview

Automated and Connected Driving Challenges (ACDC) require the integration of various software tools to address complex tasks. This documentation provides an in-depth overview of the tools used in the ACDC course, focusing on their functionalities, applications, and role in learning and development. The tools covered include **edX**, **Jupyter Notebooks**, **GitHub**, **Robot Operating System (ROS)**, **Docker**, and various programming languages.

## Course Platform: edX
**edX** serves as the central hub for course content, offering the following resources:
- **Videos**: Explaining theoretical concepts behind automated and connected driving challenges.
- **Quizzes**: Self-check assessments to reinforce learning after each unit. Regular practice prepares students for the final exam.
- **ROS Programming Descriptions**: Detailed explanations of tasks to implement in the Robot Operating System (ROS).
- **ROS Instructions**: Step-by-step guidance on using ROS tools, such as visualizing sensor data.
- **Discussion Forums**: Encouraged for engaging with peers and resolving questionst Practices:
1. Use the quizzes immediately after each unit and revisit them to strengthen understanding.
2. Leverage the discussion forums to collaborate and clarify doubts.

## Jupyter Notebooks
**Jupyter Notebooks** are interactive environments that allow students to:
- Write and execute **live code**.
- Document findings with **narrative texts** and **equations**.
- Create **visualizations** for results【12†sourcelication:
- Python programming tasks in ACDC are executed in Jupyter Notebooks.
- Notebooks enhance learning through hands-on practice and are ideal for sharing code and results with others.

## Version Control and Collaboration: GitHub
GitHub is essential for managing and sharing source code in ACDC. Key functionalities include:
- **Issues**: Used for tracking bugs and problems with the provided code.
- **Repositories**: Host the course's source code, allowing students to clone, modify, and contribute【12†sourcedelines:
1. Search for existing issues before creating a new one to avoid duplication.
2. Use GitHub issues only for software-related problems; theoretical questions belong in the edX forums.
3. Students are encouraged to contribute to the repositories and give feedback by starring repositories they find helpful.

## Middleware: Robot Operating System
**ROS** acts as middleware between user-written code and the operating system. Its main components include:
- **Message Passing System**: Facilitates communication between nodes.
- **Tools**: Includes graphical tools for configuration, visualization, debugging, and logging.
- **Capabilities**: Provides libraries for perception, mapping, planning, and control【12†sourcerning Objectives:
- Master the ROS ecosystem for integrating various functionalities in automated driving systems.
- Develop and debug applications using ROS GUI tools like **RQT** and **RVIZ**.
- Implement vehicle controllers as part of AD software stacks.

---

## Containerization: Docker
**Docker** ensures a consistent and isolated environment for running the developed software. Benefits include:
- Isolation from the host system.
- Portability across different machines.
- Ease of sharing complete environments【12†sourcege in ACDC:
- All ROS-related programming tasks run within Docker containers.
- Containers simplify the setup process, allowing students to focus on programming and debugging.

## Supporting Tools and Technologies
### Operating System: Linux
Linux, particularly **Ubuntu 20.04**, is the primary operating system for running the Docker containers and ROS.

### Shell and Command Line
The **Bash Shell** is used to interact with Linux and execute commands efficiently.

### Programming Languages
- **Python**: Used for rapid prototyping and scripting.
- **C++**: Chosen for performance-critical applications 【12†sourcon and Collaboration
The ACDC course emphasizes integrating these tools to develop robust automated driving solutions. For example:
- Use **edX** for theoretical learning and forums for discussions.
- Implement code in **Jupyter Notebooks** and test it in ROS environments.
- Leverage **GitHub** for version control and collaboration.
- Deploy software in consistent environments using **Docker**.
