An unfiltered, brutally critical take on the first week of the ACDC course—where ambition meets poor execution.

### ACDC: Bold Promises, Mild Deliveries

The Automated and Connected Driving Challenges course is an ambitious, sprawling beast. Marketed as your gateway to mastering the future of mobility, it teeters somewhere between a groundbreaking educational experience and a chaotic circus of lofty ideals, half-baked tutorials, and endless technical hurdles. Let’s peel back the layers of this onion.

### Ambition: Dream Big, Fail Small

The course proudly proclaims its mission: *"Prepare students for interdisciplinary research and inspire them to shape the future of mobility."* A noble goal, but let’s call a spade a spade. Most of us aren’t here to write groundbreaking papers or revolutionize automotive engineering. We’re here for practical skills, employable knowledge, and let’s be honest—a certificate to pad the resume.

Instead, you get drowned in concepts like "connected mobility" and "interdisciplinary function development." Translation: a lot of jargon, very little actionable knowledge. By week two, you’ll be asking yourself if you accidentally signed up for a philosophy course.

### ROS: The Holy Grail or Just Plumbing?

Ah, Robot Operating System (ROS)—the cornerstone of ACDC’s curriculum. Praised for its open-source charm and "lightweight" architecture, it’s positioned as the savior of automated systems. But let’s face it: ROS is only lightweight until you spend six hours debugging your first node, then realize it’s because of a missing package buried in the 37th subfolder.

The course promises to teach you ROS foundations, but it glosses over the fact that mastering ROS is like learning a new language while blindfolded. And then there’s ROS2—the younger, fancier sibling that everyone claims is the future, yet half the tools you need are still in beta. It’s like being told to learn Windows Vista because Windows 11 isn’t quite ready.

### Assignments: "Hands-On Learning" or Just Busy Work?

The coding assignments sound exciting on paper. Python, C++, Jupyter Notebooks—it’s a buffet of tech tools. But the execution? Let’s just say the phrase "figure it out yourself" should be in the course syllabus. The assignments oscillate between "too simplistic to be useful" and "so complex that only the professor’s pet can solve them."

What’s worse, the feedback system is non-existent. Did you submit code that barely compiles? Great, here’s a generic "good effort" badge. There’s no meaningful guidance to help you understand why your node keeps crashing, just a vague suggestion to "check the documentation"—because we all know ROS documentation is a joy to navigate.

### Tools: Death by Overengineering

Linux, Docker, GitHub, Jupyter—on their own, these tools are powerful. Together, they form a chaotic labyrinth that only seasoned developers can navigate. The course throws you into the deep end with these tools, expecting you to swim without a lifejacket. New to Docker? Too bad. Don’t know Git? Hope you like Googling.

And then there’s the infamous GitHub Issues. The course encourages collaboration by having students log their problems as issues. Sounds great, right? Until you realize that half the issues are duplicates, and the other half are barely legible cries for help.

### The A-Model: A Masterpiece of Overcomplication

The A-Model diagrams are a recurring feature, meant to show the intricacies of automated driving. In reality, they’re a beautiful mess of arrows, boxes, and terms like "Maneuver Planning" and "Stabilization." They look fantastic in a presentation but are about as useful as a chocolate teapot when it comes to actual implementation. Good luck applying them to a real-world problem.

### Objectivity Check: Is It All Bad?

No, it’s not all bad. ACDC does introduce you to some genuinely valuable concepts. The focus on ROS and its integration into connected driving is relevant, and the community-driven approach has potential. If you’re disciplined, resourceful, and willing to fill in the gaps yourself, there’s a lot to gain here.

But let’s not sugarcoat the truth: this course demands more from you than it gives back. It’s like a bad gym trainer—happy to yell at you to lift more weight but unwilling to show you proper form.

### The Verdict: Proceed with Caution

ACDC is not for the faint of heart. It’s a whirlwind of concepts, tools, and expectations that assumes you already know half the material. If you’re here for a polished, beginner-friendly experience, you’re in the wrong place. But if you enjoy chaos, have a masochistic streak, and are willing to teach yourself most of the content, ACDC might just work for you.

Just don’t forget to caffeinate. Heavily.
