A critical look at the A-Model for automated driving, its practical relevance, and the academic obsession with overengineered process models.

# A-Model? Do We Really Need This Overengineered Mess?

Every field has its overly complicated, buzzword-heavy frameworks that are more about looking impressive than actually being useful. In automated driving, the **A-Model** takes the crown. It’s a sprawling, overly ambitious diagram that tries to encapsulate everything from sensor data processing to maneuver planning. But instead of empowering engineers, it drowns them in abstraction, leaving you wondering: *Do we really need this?*

## What Even Is the A-Model?

The A-Model claims to represent the hierarchical structure of tasks required for automated driving. It splits everything into:
- **Strategic Level**: Long-term planning (e.g., route planning, traffic prediction).
- **Tactical Level**: Short-term decisions (e.g., maneuver planning, guidance).
- **Operational Level**: Immediate actions (e.g., stabilization, control).

Add in layers like **Environment Modeling**, **Self-Perception**, and **Trajectory Planning**, and you’ve got what appears to be a comprehensive framework. But peel back the layers, and what do you find? Not much beyond a fancy diagram that assumes engineers will somehow "figure it out."

## Why the A-Model Is a Headache, Not a Help

1. **It’s Overly Abstract**  
   The A-Model paints a broad picture of automated driving but offers no real instructions on how to implement anything. Sure, it tells you to "plan a trajectory" or "model the environment," but it doesn’t explain *how*. It’s like handing someone a map with no roads on it.

2. **Buzzwords Galore**  
   Look closer at the A-Model, and you’ll find it’s stuffed with terms like "Traffic Prediction" and "Self & Environment Perception." These sound impressive, but they’re deliberately vague. What tools should you use for traffic prediction? What’s the data flow for environment perception? The A-Model doesn’t care. It just throws the terms at you and walks away.

3. **No Practical Use for Engineers**  
   Engineers working on automated systems need frameworks that guide them from concept to implementation. The A-Model does nothing of the sort. Instead, it’s designed for academics to pat themselves on the back and say, "Look how comprehensive this is!" If you’re looking for actionable insights, you’ll be sorely disappointed.

4. **It’s Trying to Do Too Much**  
   The A-Model attempts to cover every aspect of automated driving, from sensor data processing to stabilization. But by cramming everything into one diagram, it becomes bloated and unwieldy. Instead of providing clarity, it overwhelms you with its sheer scope.

## Is the A-Model Completely Useless?

To be fair, the A-Model does have some redeeming qualities:
- **High-Level Overview**: It’s a decent tool for explaining the big picture to non-technical stakeholders.
- **Logical Structure**: The separation into strategic, tactical, and operational levels makes sense conceptually, even if it lacks practical depth.

But let’s not kid ourselves: these are minor benefits. When it comes to actually building automated systems, the A-Model is more of a distraction than a solution.

## Why Academia Loves Models Like This

The A-Model is a prime example of what happens when academia prioritizes appearances over practicality. Academics love these kinds of frameworks because they look good in papers, conferences, and funding proposals. They’re full of buzzwords, visually impressive, and suggest a level of mastery that isn’t actually there.

But for engineers in the field? Models like the A-Model are a dead weight. They don’t solve real problems—they just add an extra layer of abstraction to an already complex field.

## Conclusion: We Need Actionable Frameworks, Not Abstract Diagrams

The A-Model is a classic example of an academic framework that overpromises and underdelivers. While it looks impressive and provides a broad overview, it offers little to no value for actual engineers trying to solve real-world problems. Instead of empowering teams, it bogs them down in unnecessary abstraction and buzzword overload.

This obsession with overcomplicated frameworks isn’t new. I once had a professor at TU Braunschweig who was similarly obsessed with his own "design models." His approach, much like the A-Model, was full of circles, arrows, and vague terms that seemed designed to confuse rather than clarify. It was as if he believed the more convoluted the diagram, the better it was. Spoiler: It wasn’t.

We don’t need more theoretical frameworks like the A-Model or stupid maurer’s process circle. We need tools, clear methodologies, and actionable steps that help engineers build systems—not impress reviewers at academic conferences.
