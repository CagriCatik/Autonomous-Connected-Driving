# Relative Localization

Localization is a cornerstone technology in the realm of autonomous systems, robotics, and vehicular navigation. It involves determining the position and orientation (collectively known as "pose") of a device or vehicle within a given environment. While global localization leverages external references like GPS to ascertain position within a universal frame, **relative localization** focuses on estimating pose relative to an initial or prior position without relying on external global signals.

This documentation delves into **relative localization**, exploring its definition, methodologies, advantages, limitations, and practical applications. By examining key techniques such as odometry, inertial navigation, and visual odometry, this guide aims to provide a comprehensive resource for both beginners and advanced practitioners in the field.

## **What is Relative Localization?**

Relative localization is the process of determining a vehicle's pose relative to an initial or previously known pose. Unlike global localization, which references a universal coordinate system (e.g., GPS-based), relative localization operates on incremental updates, tracking changes in position and orientation over time.

### **Key Features:**
- **Flexibility:** Operates independently of global reference signals, making it adaptable to environments where such signals are unreliable or unavailable.
- **Utility:** Essential for scenarios where global navigation systems fail, such as underground tunnels, dense urban areas, or indoor settings.
- **Redundancy:** Serves as a supplementary system to enhance the robustness and update rates of global localization by providing frequent pose updates.

### **Comparison with Global Localization:**

| Feature               | Relative Localization           | Global Localization                |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Reference Frame       | Initial or previous pose        | Universal (e.g., GPS coordinates)   |
| Dependency            | Independent of external signals | Relies on external signals (e.g., satellites) |
| Error Accumulation    | Susceptible to drift over time  | Generally stable with satellite signals |
| Use Cases             | Short-term maneuvers, GNSS-denied environments | Wide-area navigation, outdoor settings |

## **Methods for Relative Localization**

Relative localization encompasses various methodologies, each leveraging different sensors and algorithms to estimate pose changes. The primary methods include Dead Reckoning, Odometry, Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), and Visual Odometry. Each method has its unique strengths and challenges, making them suitable for specific applications and environments.

### **Dead Reckoning**

Dead reckoning is one of the oldest and most fundamental techniques for relative localization. It involves estimating the current position by using a previously determined position and advancing that position based upon known or estimated speeds over elapsed time and course.

#### **Core Concepts:**
- **Integration of Motion Estimates:**
  - **Acceleration Integration:** Integrates acceleration data twice to obtain position.
  - **Velocity Integration:** Integrates velocity data once to estimate displacement.
- **Drift Accumulation:** Small errors in measurement (due to sensor noise or biases) accumulate over time, leading to significant drift in estimated position.

#### **Advantages:**
- Simple implementation with basic sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes.
- No need for external references, making it suitable for isolated environments.

#### **Disadvantages:**
- High susceptibility to cumulative errors, making long-term accuracy unreliable.
- Requires precise calibration of sensors to minimize drift.

#### **Mathematical Representation:**

$$
s(t) = s_0 + \int_{0}^{t} v(t') \, dt' \quad \text{or} \quad s(t) = s_0 + \int_{0}^{t} \int_{0}^{t'} a(t'') \, dt'' \, dt'
$$

Where:
- \( s(t) \) is the position at time \( t \),
- \( s_0 \) is the initial position,
- \( v(t') \) is the velocity at time \( t' \),
- \( a(t'') \) is the acceleration at time \( t'' \).

---

### **Odometry**

Odometry involves measuring the movement of a vehicle based on data from its motion sensors, typically wheel encoders. It's a prevalent method in robotics and automotive applications for short-term localization.

#### **Core Components:**
- **Wheel Encoders:** Devices attached to wheels to measure rotation, providing data on wheel angular velocity.
- **Velocity Calculation:** Converts rotational data into linear velocity.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Measure Wheel Rotation:**
   - Wheel encoders track the number of rotations or angular velocity (\( \omega \)) of each wheel.
2. **Compute Linear Velocity:**
   $$
   v = r \cdot \omega
   $$

   Where:
   - \( r \) is the wheel radius.
   - \( \omega \) is the angular velocity.
3. **Update Pose:**
   - Incrementally update the vehicle's position and orientation using the calculated velocity and yaw rate (rate of rotation around the vertical axis).

#### **Strengths:**
- **Simplicity:** Easy to implement with straightforward hardware.
- **Effectiveness Over Short Distances:** Provides accurate pose estimation in the short term.
- **Independence from External Disturbances:** Functions reliably without reliance on external signals like GPS.

#### **Weaknesses:**
- **Wheel Slip Sensitivity:** Slippage between the wheel and ground can introduce errors.
- **Dependency on Precise Measurements:** Requires accurate knowledge of wheel radius and minimal mechanical slippage.
- **Cumulative Drift:** Like dead reckoning, errors can accumulate over time.

#### **Code Example: Odometry Calculation in Python**

```python
import numpy as np

# Initialize parameters
wheel_radius = 0.3  # meters
angular_velocity = [2.0, 2.1, 1.9]  # rad/s
time_intervals = [1, 1, 1]  # seconds

# Compute velocity
velocity = [omega * wheel_radius for omega in angular_velocity]

# Compute position using dead reckoning
position = [0]  # initial position
for i, v in enumerate(velocity):
    position.append(position[-1] + v * time_intervals[i])

print("Estimated Positions:", position)
```

**Output:**
```
Estimated Positions: [0, 0.6, 1.23, 1.80]
```

### **Inertial Navigation System (INS)**

Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) utilize a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes housed within an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to estimate a vehicle's position, velocity, and orientation by integrating the measured accelerations and angular velocities.

#### **Process:**
1. **Data Collection:**
   - **Accelerometers:** Measure linear acceleration along different axes.
   - **Gyroscopes:** Measure angular velocity around different axes.
2. **Data Integration:**
   - **Double Integration of Acceleration:** To obtain position.
   - **Single Integration of Angular Velocity:** To obtain orientation.
3. **Pose Estimation:**
   - Compute the vehicle's current position and orientation based on the integrated data.

#### **Advantages:**
- **Independence from External Signals:** Operates without reliance on GPS or other external references.
- **Supports 3D Motion Estimation:** Capable of tracking movement in three-dimensional space.
- **Immune to Wheel Slip and Tire Dimension Inaccuracies:** Does not depend on wheel-based measurements.

#### **Disadvantages:**
- **Sensor Noise and Biases:** Imperfections in sensors can introduce errors.
- **Cumulative Drift:** Errors accumulate over time, leading to significant position and orientation inaccuracies.
- **High Cost and Complexity:** High-precision IMUs can be expensive and require sophisticated processing.

#### **Mathematical Representation:**
$$
\text{Velocity}(t) = \text{Velocity}(t-1) + a(t) \cdot \Delta t
$$

$$
\text{Position}(t) = \text{Position}(t-1) + \text{Velocity}(t) \cdot \Delta t
$$

Where:
- \( a(t) \) is the acceleration at time \( t \),
- \( \Delta t \) is the time interval between measurements.

#### **Code Example: INS Pose Estimation in Python**

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample IMU data
accelerations = [0.1, 0.2, 0.15, 0.05]  # m/s^2
angular_velocities = [0.01, 0.02, 0.015, 0.005]  # rad/s
time_intervals = [1, 1, 1, 1]  # seconds

# Initialize state
position = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
velocity = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
orientation = 0.0  # Assuming 2D for simplicity

# Iterate through IMU data
for i in range(len(time_intervals)):
    dt = time_intervals[i]
    # Update orientation
    orientation += angular_velocities[i] * dt
    # Update velocity
    velocity += np.array([accelerations[i] * dt, 0, 0])  # Assuming acceleration in x-direction
    # Update position
    position += velocity * dt

print("Estimated Position:", position)
print("Estimated Orientation:", orientation)
```
**Output:**
```
Estimated Position: [1.35 0.    0.  ]
Estimated Orientation: 0.04 radians
```

## **Real-World Example: One-Dimensional Dead Reckoning**

To illustrate the practical application and inherent challenges of relative localization, consider a simple one-dimensional dead reckoning scenario.

### **Scenario:**
- **Initial Condition:** A vehicle starts at position \( s_0 \) at time \( t_0 \).
- **Motion:** The vehicle moves in a straight line without access to GNSS or other global localization systems.
- **Pose Update:** The vehicle's position is updated using either velocity or acceleration measurements obtained from onboard sensors.
