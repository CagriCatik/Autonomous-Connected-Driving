## Programming Tasks

### 1. Implementing a Multi-Instance Kalman Filter

**Objective:** Develop a multi-instance Kalman filter to track multiple dynamic objects in an environment, enhancing the system's ability to maintain accurate and consistent object states.

**Steps:**

1. **Define the State Vector:**
   - For each object, define the state vector to include position, velocity, and possibly acceleration.
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   class KalmanFilter:
       def __init__(self, dt, u_x, u_y, std_acc, std_meas):
           # Define the state transition matrix
           self.A = np.array([[1, dt, 0.5*dt**2, 0],
                              [0, 1, dt, 0],
                              [0, 0, 1, dt],
                              [0, 0, 0, 1]])
           
           # Control input matrix
           self.B = np.array([[0.5*dt**2],
                              [dt],
                              [1],
                              [0]])
           
           # Measurement matrix
           self.H = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 1, 0]])
           
           # Process covariance
           self.Q = std_acc**2 * np.eye(self.A.shape[1])
           
           # Measurement covariance
           self.R = std_meas**2 * np.eye(self.H.shape[0])
           
           # Initial state covariance
           self.P = np.eye(self.A.shape[1])
           
           # Initial state
           self.x = np.zeros((self.A.shape[1], 1))
           
       def predict(self, u):
           # Predict the next state
           self.x = np.dot(self.A, self.x) + np.dot(self.B, u)
           self.P = np.dot(np.dot(self.A, self.P), self.A.T) + self.Q
           return self.x
       
       def update(self, z):
           # Compute the Kalman Gain
           S = np.dot(np.dot(self.H, self.P), self.H.T) + self.R
           K = np.dot(np.dot(self.P, self.H.T), np.linalg.inv(S))
           
           # Update the state
           y = z - np.dot(self.H, self.x)
           self.x = self.x + np.dot(K, y)
           
           # Update the covariance
           I = np.eye(self.H.shape[1])
           self.P = np.dot((I - np.dot(K, self.H)), self.P)
           
           return self.x
   ```

2. **Initialize Filters for Multiple Objects:**
   - Create a separate Kalman filter instance for each object being tracked.
   ```python
   # Example for tracking two objects
   dt = 1.0
   u_x = 0
   u_y = 0
   std_acc = 1
   std_meas = 1

   kf1 = KalmanFilter(dt, u_x, u_y, std_acc, std_meas)
   kf2 = KalmanFilter(dt, u_x, u_y, std_acc, std_meas)
   ```

3. **Process Measurements:**
   - For each time step, predict and update the state of each tracked object based on new measurements.
   ```python
   # Example measurement updates
   measurements = {
       'object1': np.array([[1], [1]]),
       'object2': np.array([[2], [2]])
   }

   # Predict
   kf1.predict(0)
   kf2.predict(0)

   # Update
   kf1.update(measurements['object1'])
   kf2.update(measurements['object2'])

   print("Object 1 State:", kf1.x)
   print("Object 2 State:", kf2.x)
   ```

   chmod +x scripts
   ```

3. **Implement Object Association Node:**
   - Develop a node to associate incoming sensor data with existing tracked objects.
   ```python
   # scripts/object_association.py
   import rospy
   from sensor_msgs.msg import PointCloud
   from std_msgs.msg import Header
   import numpy as np
   from kalman_filter import KalmanFilter  # Assuming KalmanFilter is defined as above

   class ObjectAssociation:
       def __init__(self):
           self.kf_list = []
           self.sub = rospy.Subscriber('/sensor/point_cloud', PointCloud, self.callback)
           self.pub = rospy.Publisher('/tracked_objects', PointCloud, queue_size=10)
       
       def callback(self, data):
           # Process incoming point cloud data
           for point in data.points:
               associated = False
               for kf in self.kf_list:
                   if self.is_associated(kf, point):
                       kf.update(np.array([[point.x], [point.y]]))
                       associated = True
                       break
               if not associated:
                   new_kf = KalmanFilter(dt=1.0, u_x=0, u_y=0, std_acc=1, std_meas=1)
                   new_kf.x = np.array([[point.x], [0], [point.y], [0]])
                   self.kf_list.append(new_kf)
           
           # Publish tracked objects
           tracked = PointCloud()
           tracked.header = Header()
           tracked.header.stamp = rospy.Time.now()
           for kf in self.kf_list:
               tracked.points.append(kf.x[:2].flatten().tolist())
           self.pub.publish(tracked)
       
       def is_associated(self, kf, point, threshold=1.0):
           # Simple distance-based association
           pos = kf.x[:2].flatten()
           distance = np.linalg.norm(np.array([point.x, point.y]) - pos)
           return distance < threshold

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       rospy.init_node('object_association')
       oa = ObjectAssociation()
       rospy.spin()
   ```

4. **Run the ROS Nodes:**
   - Build the workspace and launch the object tracking node.

   ```

### 3. Integrating Dynamic Object Lists for Automated Driving Tasks

**Objective:** Incorporate dynamic object lists into the environment model to facilitate automated driving tasks such as obstacle avoidance and path planning.

**Steps:**

1. **Maintain a Dynamic Object List:**
   - Create a data structure to store and update information about each tracked object.
   ```python
   class DynamicObject:
       def __init__(self, id, initial_state):
           self.id = id
           self.state = initial_state
           self.history = [initial_state]
       
       def update_state(self, new_state):
           self.state = new_state
           self.history.append(new_state)
   
   class EnvironmentModel:
       def __init__(self):
           self.objects = {}
       
       def add_object(self, obj_id, initial_state):
           self.objects[obj_id] = DynamicObject(obj_id, initial_state)
       
       def update_object(self, obj_id, new_state):
           if obj_id in self.objects:
               self.objects[obj_id].update_state(new_state)
           else:
               self.add_object(obj_id, new_state)
       
       def get_current_objects(self):
           return {obj_id: obj.state for obj_id, obj in self.objects.items()}
   ```

2. **Integrate with Tracking Nodes:**
   - Update the dynamic object list based on tracking data from Kalman filters.
   ```python
   # Extend the object_association.py script
   class ObjectAssociation:
       def __init__(self):
           self.kf_list = []
           self.env_model = EnvironmentModel()
           # ... existing initialization ...
       
       def callback(self, data):
           # ... existing processing ...
           for idx, kf in enumerate(self.kf_list):
               self.env_model.update_object(idx, kf.x[:2].flatten())
           
           # Publish tracked objects
           tracked = PointCloud()
           tracked.header = Header()
           tracked.header.stamp = rospy.Time.now()
           for obj_id, state in self.env_model.get_current_objects().items():
               point = Point()
               point.x, point.y = state
               tracked.points.append(point)
           self.pub.publish(tracked)
   ```

3. **Utilize Dynamic Object Data for Driving Tasks:**
   - Implement obstacle avoidance by adjusting the vehicle's path based on the positions and velocities of dynamic objects.
   ```python
   class PathPlanner:
       def __init__(self):
           self.sub = rospy.Subscriber('/tracked_objects', PointCloud, self.callback)
           self.pub = rospy.Publisher('/vehicle/path', Path, queue_size=10)
       
       def callback(self, data):
           # Simple avoidance: shift path away from closest object
           if not data.points:
               return
           
           closest = min(data.points, key=lambda p: np.linalg.norm([p.x, p.y]))
           avoidance_vector = np.array([closest.x, closest.y])
           if np.linalg.norm(avoidance_vector) < 5.0:
               # Adjust path
               new_path = Path()
               new_path.header = Header(stamp=rospy.Time.now())
               new_waypoint = Waypoint()
               new_waypoint.x = avoidance_vector[0] + 5.0
               new_waypoint.y = avoidance_vector[1] + 5.0
               new_path.waypoints.append(new_waypoint)
               self.pub.publish(new_path)
   ```
