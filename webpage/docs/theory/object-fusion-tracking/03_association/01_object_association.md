# Object Association 

Object association plays a pivotal role in multi-sensor data fusion, especially when integrating outputs from diverse sensor systems into a cohesive representation within robotic applications. Utilizing frameworks like the Robot Operating System (ROS), object association ensures that data from various sensors is accurately merged to form a unified understanding of the environment. This guide delves into object association within the Kalman filter framework, emphasizing two primary methodologies: **Intersection over Union (IoU)** and **Mahalanobis Distance**. Both techniques are essential for linking sensor-level objects with global-level objects, thereby facilitating precise and consistent data fusion.

---

## Context

In a multi-sensor fusion pipeline, object association is a crucial step that follows temporal alignment. The typical stages are:

1. **Temporal Alignment**: Synchronizing objects detected by different sensors to the same temporal frame.
2. **Object Association**: Establishing correspondences between sensor-level objects and global-level objects, which is essential for accurately fusing sensor data into global states.

This guide focuses on the **Object Association** phase, exploring methodologies to effectively link detections from multiple sensors within the Kalman filter framework.

## Object Association Approaches

Object association ensures that detections from various sensors correspond to the same physical object in the environment. This correspondence is vital for accurate state estimation and data fusion. Two primary methods are explored here: **Intersection over Union (IoU)** and **Mahalanobis Distance**.

### 1. Intersection over Union (IoU)

#### Definition

Intersection over Union (IoU) is a metric widely used in object detection to quantify the overlap between two bounding boxes. In the context of object association, IoU measures the spatial overlap between sensor-detected objects and global objects to determine their correspondence.

#### Assumptions

- Objects are represented as rectangular bounding boxes.
- Bounding boxes are axis-aligned (i.e., orientations are aligned).

#### Formula

$$
\[
\text{IoU} = \frac{\text{Area of Intersection}}{\text{Area of Union}}
\]
$$

#### Procedure

1. **Compute Intersection and Union**: Determine the overlapping area between the two bounding boxes (Intersection) and the total area covered by both boxes (Union).
2. **Calculate IoU**: Divide the area of intersection by the area of union.
3. **Decision Making**:
   - If $ \text{IoU} > K $ (a predefined threshold), the objects are considered associated.
   - If $ \text{IoU} \leq K $, the objects are not linked.

#### Example

Consider two bounding boxes:

- **Box A**: $ (x_1, y_1, w_1, h_1) $
- **Box B**: $ (x_2, y_2, w_2, h_2) $

By calculating the coordinates of the intersection and union areas, we can determine their IoU and decide whether to associate them based on the threshold $ K $.

### 2. Mahalanobis Distance

#### Definition

Mahalanobis Distance is a statistical measure that accounts for the correlations and variances of data, making it robust for associating objects with high uncertainty. It is particularly effective in scenarios where different sensors exhibit varying error characteristics in the x and y directions.

#### Advantages

- **Robustness to Uncertainty**: Considers the covariance of the data, making it suitable for measurements with different levels of uncertainty.
- **Adaptability**: Can handle varying error variances, enhancing association accuracy in complex environments.

#### Formula

$$
\[
d_{G,S} = \sqrt{\Delta \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{S}^{-1} \Delta \mathbf{x}}
\]
$$

Where:
- $ \Delta \mathbf{x} $: Difference between the global state vector and the sensor state vector.
- $ \mathbf{S} $: Covariance matrix mapped onto the x-y plane.

#### Procedure

1. **Compute Difference**: Calculate $ \Delta \mathbf{x} $ by projecting both the global state and sensor state vectors onto the x-y plane using a projection matrix $ \mathbf{H} $.
2. **Normalize Difference**: Divide $ \Delta \mathbf{x} $ by the covariance matrix $ \mathbf{S} $.
3. **Calculate Distance**: Compute $ d_{G,S} $ as the square root of the resulting value.
4. **Decision Making**:
   - If $ d_{G,S} < K $ (a predefined threshold), the objects are associated.
   - Otherwise, they are not linked.

#### Example

Given a global object state and a sensor-detected object state with their respective covariance matrices, Mahalanobis Distance can quantify the similarity between them, facilitating accurate association even in the presence of significant measurement uncertainties.

## Implementation in ROS

Implementing object association within ROS involves integrating the IoU and Mahalanobis Distance methods into the existing Kalman filter node. This section outlines the setup, steps, and provides code snippets for both methods.

### 1. Setup

- **ROS Version**: Use **ROS2** for its improved performance and features. However, ROS1 can also be used if necessary.
- **Programming Language**: 
  - **Python**: Ideal for rapid prototyping and ease of use.
  - **C++**: Suitable for optimized computation and performance-critical applications.

Ensure that the development environment is properly set up with ROS2 or ROS1 installed, and that the necessary dependencies for Python or C++ development are in place.

### 2. Steps

1. **Implement IoU and Mahalanobis Distance Calculations**:
   - Develop separate modules or functions for each method to maintain modularity and ease of maintenance.
2. **Integrate with Kalman Filter Node**:
   - Incorporate the association modules into the existing Kalman filter node to enable real-time data fusion based on object associations.
3. **Define Thresholds ($ K $)**:
   - Determine appropriate threshold values for both IoU and Mahalanobis Distance based on the specific application requirements and sensor characteristics.
4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Rigorously test the implementation using simulated and real-world data to ensure accurate associations and system robustness.

### 3. Code Snippets

Below are Python implementations for both IoU and Mahalanobis Distance calculations.

#### IoU Calculation in Python

```python
def compute_iou(box1, box2):
    """
    Compute the Intersection over Union (IoU) of two bounding boxes.

    Parameters:
    - box1: Tuple or list with coordinates (x, y, width, height)
    - box2: Tuple or list with coordinates (x, y, width, height)

    Returns:
    - iou: Float representing the IoU value
    """
    # Extract coordinates
    x1, y1, w1, h1 = box1
    x2, y2, w2, h2 = box2

    # Compute the (x, y)-coordinates of the intersection rectangle
    xi1 = max(x1, x2)
    yi1 = max(y1, y2)
    xi2 = min(x1 + w1, x2 + w2)
    yi2 = min(y1 + h1, y2 + h2)

    # Compute width and height of the intersection rectangle
    inter_width = max(0, xi2 - xi1)
    inter_height = max(0, yi2 - yi1)

    # Compute the area of intersection
    intersection = inter_width * inter_height

    # Compute the area of both bounding boxes
    area_box1 = w1 * h1
    area_box2 = w2 * h2

    # Compute the area of union
    union = area_box1 + area_box2 - intersection

    # Avoid division by zero
    if union == 0:
        return 0.0

    # Compute IoU
    iou = intersection / union
    return iou
```

**Usage Example**:

```python
box_a = (50, 50, 100, 150)  # (x, y, width, height)
box_b = (60, 60, 100, 150)
iou_value = compute_iou(box_a, box_b)
print(f"IoU: {iou_value:.2f}")
```

#### Mahalanobis Distance in Python

```python
import numpy as np

def mahalanobis_distance(x_global, x_sensor, cov_matrix):
    """
    Compute the Mahalanobis Distance between global and sensor state vectors.

    Parameters:
    - x_global: Numpy array representing the global state vector
    - x_sensor: Numpy array representing the sensor state vector
    - cov_matrix: Numpy array representing the covariance matrix

    Returns:
    - distance: Float representing the Mahalanobis Distance
    """
    # Compute the difference vector
    delta = np.subtract(x_global, x_sensor)

    try:
        # Compute the inverse of the covariance matrix
        inv_cov = np.linalg.inv(cov_matrix)
    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
        # Handle singular covariance matrix
        raise ValueError("Covariance matrix is singular and cannot be inverted.")

    # Compute the Mahalanobis Distance
    distance = np.sqrt(np.dot(np.dot(delta.T, inv_cov), delta))
    return distance
```

**Usage Example**:

```python
# Define global and sensor state vectors
x_global = np.array([10.0, 20.0])
x_sensor = np.array([12.0, 18.0])

# Define the covariance matrix
cov_matrix = np.array([[4.0, 0.0],
                       [0.0, 9.0]])

distance = mahalanobis_distance(x_global, x_sensor, cov_matrix)
print(f"Mahalanobis Distance: {distance:.2f}")
```

**Explanation**:

- **ObjectAssociationNode**:
  - Subscribes to a topic (`sensor_objects`) publishing sensor-detected bounding boxes.
  - Maintains a list of global objects, each with its bounding box, state vector, and covariance matrix.
  - For each incoming sensor detection, it attempts to associate it with existing global objects using IoU and Mahalanobis Distance.
  - If an association is found, it updates the global object's state and covariance using a simplified Kalman Filter update.
  - If no association is found, it initializes a new global object.

- **Functions**:
  - `compute_iou`: Calculates the IoU between two bounding boxes.
  - `mahalanobis_distance`: Computes the Mahalanobis Distance between two state vectors considering their covariance.
