protocol_version = decoded_cam['header']['protocolVersion']
message_id = decoded_cam['header']['messageID']
station_id = decoded_cam['header']['stationID']

cam_id = decoded_cam['id']
latitude = decoded_cam['position']['latitude']
longitude = decoded_cam['position']['longitude']
altitude = decoded_cam['position']['altitude']

speed = decoded_cam['speed']
heading = decoded_cam['heading']

braking = decoded_cam['status']['braking']
turning = decoded_cam['status']['turning']

print(f"Protocol Version: {protocol_version}")
print(f"Message ID: {message_id}")
print(f"Station ID: {station_id}")
print(f"CAM ID: {cam_id}")
print(f"Position: Latitude={latitude}, Longitude={longitude}, Altitude={altitude}")
print(f"Speed: {speed} km/h")
print(f"Heading: {heading} degrees")
print(f"Braking: {braking}")
print(f"Turning: {turning}")
```

**Output:**
```
Protocol Version: 1
Message ID: 1
Station ID: 12345
CAM ID: 67890
Position: Latitude=52.52, Longitude=13.405, Altitude=34.0
Speed: 50.0 km/h
Heading: 90.0 degrees
Braking: False
