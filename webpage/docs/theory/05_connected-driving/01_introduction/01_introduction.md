## Learning Tasks

To ensure a comprehensive understanding of Connected Driving, the module incorporates a variety of interactive and practical learning activities:

### Coding Assignments

**Objective:** Implement connected driving functionalities using frameworks such as ROS (Robot Operating System).

**Example Assignment: Setting Up V2X Communication**

Develop a ROS node that simulates Vehicle-to-Intersection (V2I) communication by exchanging messages with a traffic light system.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import String

def v2x_communication():
    rospy.init_node('v2x_node', anonymous=True)
    pub = rospy.Publisher('traffic_signal', String, queue_size=10)
    rate = rospy.Rate(10)  # 10 Hz

    while not rospy.is_shutdown():
        traffic_status = "Green Light"
        rospy.loginfo(traffic_status)
        pub.publish(traffic_status)
        rate.sleep()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        v2x_communication()
    except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
        pass
```

**Explanation:**
- **Initialization:** The ROS node `v2x_node` is initialized.
- **Publisher Setup:** A publisher is created to send messages on the `traffic_signal` topic.
- **Loop:** The node publishes the traffic signal status ("Green Light") at a rate of 10 Hz until shutdown.

### Quizzes

**Objective:** Reinforce conceptual understanding through self-assessment.

**Example Question:**
