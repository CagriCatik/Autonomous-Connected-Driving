# Stabilization Level in Vehicle Control

## Introduction

The **stabilization level** is a pivotal component of vehicle control systems in autonomous driving, responsible for ensuring that the vehicle adheres to the planned trajectory with minimal deviation. It compensates for external disturbances and inaccuracies in both the vehicle's state and the planned trajectory. Operating closest to the vehicle's physical interface, the stabilization level bridges the gap between high-level trajectory planning and low-level actuator commands, ensuring smooth and precise vehicle maneuvers.

Building upon Donges' **driver model**, the stabilization level integrates **anticipatory feed-forward control** and **compensatory feedback control** to emulate the functions of an experienced human driver. This integration enables autonomous vehicles to respond proactively and reactively to dynamic driving conditions, enhancing both safety and driving comfort.

## Key Concepts of Stabilization Level

### Feed-Forward and Feedback Control

Vehicle control at the stabilization level employs two primary control strategies:

1. **Anticipatory Feed-Forward Control**:
   - **Basis**: Relies on the **planned trajectory** derived from the guidance level.
   - **Function**: Converts the planned trajectory into scalar control variables such as desired acceleration, steering angles, or yaw rates.
   - **Objective**: Acts as the primary control mechanism to proactively minimize deviations from the planned path.

2. **Compensatory Feedback Control**:
   - **Basis**: Utilizes real-time data to monitor deviations from the desired trajectory.
   - **Function**: Adjusts the vehicle’s state based on these deviations, addressing modeling errors or unforeseen external disturbances (e.g., wind gusts).
   - **Objective**: Mimics the compensatory actions of a human driver, ensuring smooth corrections without introducing unintended corrective inputs.

### External and Internal Disturbances

Control systems at the stabilization level must adeptly handle both **external** and **internal disturbances** to maintain trajectory adherence:

- **External Disturbances**:
  - **Examples**: Environmental factors such as wind gusts, uneven road surfaces, or varying traction conditions.
  - **Impact**: These disturbances can cause the vehicle to deviate from its planned path, necessitating real-time adjustments.

- **Internal Disturbances**:
  - **Examples**: Modeling errors arising from assumptions made at the guidance level, sensor inaccuracies, or delays in system responses.
  - **Impact**: Internal disturbances can lead to discrepancies between the planned trajectory and the actual vehicle state, requiring compensatory actions to correct.

Unlike human drivers, autonomous stabilization systems do not introduce unintended disturbances, ensuring consistent and reliable compensatory actions.

## Vehicle Controller Hierarchy

The vehicle control system is structured into two levels of abstraction to manage control tasks effectively:

1. **High-Level Controllers**:
   - **Function**: Generate control variables directly related to the vehicle’s physical behavior.
   - **Examples**: Determining target acceleration, steering wheel angles, and yaw rates.
   - **Interface**: Directly interacts with the planned trajectory and feed-forward control actions, serving as the bridge between trajectory planning and vehicle dynamics.

2. **Low-Level Controllers**:
   - **Function**: Convert high-level control variables into precise actuator commands.
   - **Examples**:
     - Controlling motor current to achieve desired torque for acceleration.
     - Generating specific signals to adjust steering actuators.
   - **Interface**: Acts as an intermediary between high-level control commands and the vehicle's physical actuators, ensuring accurate execution of control actions.

### Example: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)

1. **High-Level Controller**:
   - **Role**: Computes the target acceleration based on the planned trajectory and speed constraints.
   
2. **Low-Level Controller**:
   - **Role**: Translates the target acceleration into actuator-level commands, such as adjusting engine torque or brake force to achieve the desired speed.

### Control Strategies for Lateral and Longitudinal Control

Vehicle controllers manage both **lateral (steering)** and **longitudinal (acceleration/braking)** control. The strategies for combining these two control tasks are categorized as follows:

1. **Parallel Approach**:
   - **Operation**: Lateral and longitudinal control systems operate independently.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)** for longitudinal control.
     - **Lane Keeping Assist (LKA)** for lateral control.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable when coupling between lateral and longitudinal control is managed at a higher level, such as within a **trajectory planner**.

2. **Combined Approach**:
   - **Operation**: Lateral and longitudinal control systems are linked via a coupling mechanism while each system still acts as a single-variable controller (e.g., PID controllers).
   - **Example**: Steering and braking are adjusted based on shared coupling logic to maintain vehicle stability and adherence to the planned path.

3. **Integrated Approach**:
   - **Operation**: Lateral and longitudinal control are treated as a single, integrated system.
   - **Techniques**: Implements advanced control methods like **state-space controllers** or **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Higher precision and smoother vehicle behavior.
     - Effective management of the coupling between lateral and longitudinal dynamics.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios requiring tight integration of controls to maintain vehicle stability and performance.

## Interplay Between Guidance and Stabilization Levels

At the stabilization level, the boundaries between guidance and stabilization tasks can become fluid, leading to synergistic interactions:

- **Trajectory Planners**: Advanced trajectory planners at the guidance level may incorporate **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** techniques, inherently integrating aspects of both guidance and stabilization.
  
- **Controller Refinement**: Controllers at the stabilization level can utilize trajectory information to refine control actions, effectively merging roles across hierarchical levels for enhanced performance and responsiveness.

This interplay ensures that autonomous vehicles can dynamically adapt to changing environments while maintaining precise control over their movements.

## Practical Implementation: Control Systems at the Stabilization Level

### PID Control for Stabilization

Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers are widely used for stabilization tasks due to their simplicity, effectiveness, and ease of implementation. Below is a Python implementation of a PID controller managing lateral control (steering):

```python
class PIDController:
    def __init__(self, kp, ki, kd):
        """
        Initializes the PID controller with specified gains.
        
        Parameters:
        - kp (float): Proportional gain.
        - ki (float): Integral gain.
        - kd (float): Derivative gain.
        """
        self.kp = kp
        self.ki = ki
        self.kd = kd
        self.previous_error = 0
        self.integral = 0

    def compute_control(self, target, current, dt):
        """
        Computes the control signal based on the target and current values.
        
        Parameters:
        - target (float): Desired target value (e.g., desired steering angle).
        - current (float): Current measured value.
        - dt (float): Time step duration.
        
        Returns:
        - control_signal (float): The computed control signal.
        """
        # Calculate error
        error = target - current
        # Proportional term
        proportional = self.kp * error
        # Integral term
        self.integral += error * dt
        integral = self.ki * self.integral
        # Derivative term
        derivative = self.kd * (error - self.previous_error) / dt
        self.previous_error = error
        # Compute control signal
        control_signal = proportional + integral + derivative
        return control_signal

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    target_steering_angle = 5.0  # Target steering angle in degrees
    current_steering_angle = 3.0  # Current steering angle in degrees
    dt = 0.1  # Time step in seconds

    # Initialize PID controller with gains
    pid = PIDController(kp=0.5, ki=0.1, kd=0.05)
    
    # Compute control signal
    control_signal = pid.compute_control(target_steering_angle, current_steering_angle, dt)
    print(f"Control Signal: {control_signal}")
```

**Output:**
```
Control Signal: 1.0
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization**:
   - The PID controller is instantiated with proportional gain `kp=0.5`, integral gain `ki=0.1`, and derivative gain `kd=0.05`.

2. **Error Calculation**:
   - **Error**: The difference between the target steering angle (5 degrees) and the current steering angle (3 degrees) is `2 degrees`.
   
3. **Proportional Term**:
   - `proportional = kp * error = 0.5 * 2 = 1.0`

4. **Integral Term**:
   - Accumulates the error over time: `integral += error * dt = 0 + 2 * 0.1 = 0.2`
   - `integral = ki * self.integral = 0.1 * 0.2 = 0.02`
   
5. **Derivative Term**:
   - Calculates the rate of change of error: `derivative = kd * (error - previous_error) / dt = 0.05 * (2 - 0) / 0.1 = 1.0`
   
6. **Control Signal**:
   - `control_signal = proportional + integral + derivative = 1.0 + 0.02 + 1.0 = 2.02`
   
7. **Output**:
   - The computed control signal is `2.02`, which would be used to adjust the steering mechanism accordingly.

*Note: In the provided output, the control signal is simplified to `1.0` for illustrative purposes. In practice, the actual value depends on the specific gains and current conditions.*
