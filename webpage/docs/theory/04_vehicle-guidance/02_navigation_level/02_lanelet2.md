## Core Concepts of Lanelet2

Understanding the foundational elements of Lanelet2 is crucial for leveraging its full potential in autonomous driving systems. This section delves into the primary components that constitute the Lanelet2 framework.

### Lanelets: Building Blocks of the Road Network

A **lanelet** serves as the fundamental unit within Lanelet2, encapsulating both spatial and semantic information essential for accurate road network representation.

- **Two Bounding Linestrings**: Each lanelet is defined by a left and right linestring that demarcate the boundaries of a road lane.
- **Driving Direction**: The orientation of the linestrings implies the permissible driving direction within the lanelet.
- **Semantic Attributes**: Lanelets can carry various attributes such as lane type (e.g., driving lane, shoulder), speed limits, and access restrictions (e.g., no entry zones).

By structuring road networks as directed graphs composed of interconnected lanelets, Lanelet2 facilitates efficient navigation and route planning processes.

### Linestrings: Linear Road Features

**Linestrings** are geometric primitives within Lanelet2, representing linear road features essential for constructing lanelets and other map elements.

- **Points**: Each linestring comprises a series of connected points, each with unique identifiers and 3D coordinates.
- **Attributes**: Linestrings carry attributes that describe their physical characteristics, such as whether the boundary is "solid" or "dashed," indicating whether it can be crossed by a vehicle.

Linestrings form the backbone of lanelet construction, enabling precise delineation of lane boundaries and other linear features like crosswalks and stop lines.

### Primitives: The Map's DNA

Lanelet2 maps are constructed using a hierarchy of primitives that provide both geometric and semantic richness.

- **Points**: The most basic unit, defined by unique IDs and spatial coordinates.
- **Linestrings**: Connected points forming lane boundaries, road markings, and other linear features.
- **Lanelets**: Combinations of two linestrings (left and right boundaries) defining a drivable lane.
- **Polygons**: Represent larger spatial areas such as intersections, parking zones, or restricted areas.
- **Regulatory Elements**: Define traffic rules and constraints, including speed limits, stop signs, and yield signs.

These primitives offer a flexible yet detailed representation of the road network, supporting a wide range of use cases from urban driving scenarios to highway automation.

## Route Planning with Lanelet2

Route planning within Lanelet2 leverages its comprehensive map representation to facilitate efficient and accurate navigation.

### Routing Graph

At the heart of Lanelet2's route planning capabilities is the **routing graph**, which encapsulates connectivity and relational information among lanelets. Routing graphs are customized for different types of road users, including:

- **Vehicles**: Standard passenger and commercial vehicles navigating regular lanes.
- **Pedestrians**: Representing footpaths, crosswalks, and pedestrian zones.
- **Emergency Vehicles**: Allowing access to restricted lanes or special areas for rapid response.

The routing graph integrates various attributes such as lane width, road type, and traffic regulations, offering a holistic representation of the navigable environment.

### Dijkstra Algorithm in Lanelet2

Lanelet2 employs the **Dijkstra algorithm** for efficient route planning. This approach involves several key steps:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - **Nodes**: Correspond to individual lanelets within the map.
   - **Edges**: Represent possible transitions between connected lanelets, each associated with a cost metric (e.g., distance, time, energy consumption).

2. **Cost Function**:
   - Assigns cost values to edges based on predefined metrics like distance traveled, expected travel time, or energy usage, influencing the route selection process.

3. **Shortest Path Computation**:
   - The Dijkstra algorithm identifies the optimal sequence of lanelets that minimizes the total cost from the starting point to the destination.

### Route vs. Shortest Path

- **Route**: Encompasses all possible lanelets that could potentially lead to the destination, providing a comprehensive set of navigable paths.
- **Shortest Path**: Represents the most optimal sequence of lanelets that minimizes the chosen cost function, such as the shortest distance or least travel time.

The shortest path derived from the routing graph serves as the foundation for subsequent motion planning algorithms, ensuring the vehicle follows the most efficient and feasible trajectory.

- **Attributes**:
  - **Type**: Specifies the nature of the linestring (e.g., solid, dashed), indicating whether it can be crossed by a vehicle.
  - **Usage**: Utilized to represent lane boundaries, crosswalks, stop lines, and other linear road elements.

Linestrings are essential for delineating the physical boundaries and markings of roadways, ensuring clear and precise map representations.

### Lanelets

- **Definition**: Logical combinations of two linestrings defining the left and right boundaries of a drivable lane.
- **Attributes**:
  - **Directionality**: Inferred from the orientation of the left and right linestrings, indicating permissible driving directions.
  - **Relational Data**: Connectivity information linking lanelets to adjacent lanes, facilitating seamless routing and navigation.

Lanelets enable the map to be represented as a directed graph, supporting efficient route planning and navigation algorithms.

### Regulatory Elements

- **Definition**: Semantic components that define traffic rules and constraints within the map.
- **Attributes**:
  - **Speed Limits**: Maximum and minimum permissible speeds for specific lanelets.
  - **Right-of-Way Rules**: Indicate which lanes or directions have priority in intersections or merging scenarios.
  - **Stop or Yield Signs**: Mark locations where vehicles must stop or yield to other traffic.

Regulatory elements are integrated with specific lanelets, ensuring that navigation and motion planning algorithms adhere to traffic laws and safety regulations.

projection = lanelet2.io.Origin(0.0, 0.0)  # Adjust projection parameters as needed
map_data = lanelet2.io.load(map_file, projection)

# Create traffic rules for vehicles
traffic_rules = lanelet2.traffic_rules.create(
    lanelet2.traffic_rules.Locations.Germany,  # Specify the location for traffic rules
    lanelet2.traffic_rules.Participants.Vehicle
)

routing_graph = RoutingGraph(map_data, traffic_rules)

# Specify start and end lanelets by their unique IDs
start_lanelet = map_data.laneletLayer.get(1)  # Replace with the actual start lanelet ID
end_lanelet = map_data.laneletLayer.get(100)  # Replace with the actual end lanelet ID

# Compute the shortest path using the routing graph
shortest_path = routing_graph.shortestPath(start_lanelet, end_lanelet)

# Extract the sequence of lanelet IDs from the shortest path
lanelet_ids = [lanelet.id for lanelet in shortest_path.getRemainingLane()]
