# Introduction to Guidance-Level Motion Planning

The **guidance-level** task in autonomous driving is pivotal for achieving precise motion planning and control, enabling a vehicle to transition seamlessly from an initial state to a desired goal state. Building upon foundational concepts of vehicle guidance, such as the **Optimal Control Problem (OCP)**, this section delves into three primary methods for solving the OCP: **dynamic programming**, **direct approaches**, and **indirect approaches**. Central to this exploration is the **model of vehicle guidance by Donges**, which provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and implementing these methodologies.

Motion planning at the guidance level typically involves shorter optimization horizons and finer control over system states and constraints compared to the navigation level. This granularity ensures that autonomous vehicles can respond swiftly and accurately to dynamic driving conditions, enhancing both safety and efficiency.

## The Optimal Control Problem (OCP)

### Definition

The **Optimal Control Problem (OCP)** is a fundamental concept in control theory and motion planning. It involves determining the optimal trajectory that transitions a system from an initial state $ x(0) $ to a target state $ x(t_f) $ while satisfying system dynamics and constraints, all while minimizing a predefined cost function. In the context of autonomous driving, the vehicle achieves this by manipulating its control variables $ u(t) $, such as steering angle and acceleration.

### Formulation

Mathematically, the OCP can be expressed as:

$$
\min_{u(t)} J = \int_0^{t_f} L(x(t), u(t), t) \, dt
$$

**Subject to:**
- **System Dynamics:**

  $\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t), u(t), t)$

- **Equality Constraints:**

  $g(x(t), u(t)) = 0$

- **Inequality Constraints:**

  $h(x(t), u(t)) \leq 0$


**Where:**
- $x(t)$: Represents the system state at time $ t $ (e.g., position, velocity).
- $u(t)$: Denotes the control inputs at time $ t $ (e.g., steering angle, acceleration).
- $J$: The cost function to be minimized, which could represent metrics like energy consumption, travel time, or path smoothness.
- $ L(x(t), u(t), t) $: The instantaneous cost function.

### Constraints

1. **Equality Constraints ($g$)**:
   - These define strict requirements that must be met, such as achieving a specific velocity at the target state or ensuring the vehicle reaches a precise location.
2. **Inequality Constraints ($h$)**:
   - These ensure safety and physical feasibility, such as avoiding collisions, respecting speed limits, or adhering to maximum steering angles.

### Solution Space

The OCP's solution space comprises all possible trajectories that satisfy the system dynamics and constraints. Among these, the optimal trajectory is the one that minimizes the cost function $ J $. Due to the complexity and high dimensionality of real-world driving scenarios, multiple trajectories may satisfy the constraints, necessitating efficient algorithms to identify the most optimal one.

## Methods to Solve the Optimal Control Problem

Solving the OCP requires robust methodologies that can navigate the intricate balance between optimality, computational efficiency, and real-time applicability. The three primary methods explored here are **dynamic programming**, **direct approaches**, and **indirect approaches**.

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a mathematical optimization technique rooted in **Bellman’s principle of optimality**. It addresses the OCP by decomposing it into smaller, manageable subproblems, solving each optimally, and combining their solutions to address the overarching problem.

**Bellman’s Principle of Optimality** states:
*"An optimal policy has the property that, regardless of the initial state and decision, the subsequent decisions must form an optimal policy concerning the resulting state."*

**Advantages:**
- **Global Optimization Guarantees:** Ensures the identification of the globally optimal solution for well-defined problems.
- **Flexibility in Handling Constraints:** Effectively manages complex constraints and multiple objectives.
- **Suitability for Combinatorial Problems:** Efficiently addresses problems with numerous discrete states or decisions.

**Limitations:**
- **Curse of Dimensionality:** As the number of system states increases, the computational complexity grows exponentially, making real-time applications challenging.
- **High Computational Overhead:** Solving large-scale problems demands substantial computational resources, potentially limiting scalability.

**Applications:**
- **Global Motion Planning:** Ideal for long-horizon planning tasks where comprehensive optimization is feasible despite higher computational demands.

### Direct Approaches

Direct approaches reformulate the OCP into a **Nonlinear Programming (NLP)** problem by discretizing control variables and, optionally, system states. These methods translate the continuous optimization problem into a finite-dimensional one, which can then be solved using numerical optimization techniques.

#### Key Techniques in Direct Approaches

1. **Direct Collocation:**
   - **Description:** Both system controls and states are discretized. The entire trajectory is treated as a single optimization problem where all variables are optimized simultaneously.
   - **Advantages:**
     - High accuracy due to the explicit inclusion of system states in the optimization.
     - Suitable for problems requiring precise trajectory planning.
   - **Limitations:**
     - High computational cost, especially for large-scale problems with numerous discretization points.

2. **Single Shooting:**
   - **Description:** Only the control variables are discretized. System states are derived sequentially through forward integration of system dynamics based on these controls.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Simplifies the optimization process by reducing the number of variables.
     - Lower computational requirements compared to direct collocation.
   - **Limitations:**
     - Sensitive to initial guesses, which can lead to convergence issues or numerical instability.
     - Less robust in handling complex constraints and dynamic environments.

3. **Multiple Shooting:**
   - **Description:** Combines features of direct collocation and single shooting by discretizing control variables and dividing the trajectory into multiple segments. System states are computed through forward integration over these segments, with continuity constraints enforced between them.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Balances computational cost and robustness, providing a more stable solution compared to single shooting.
     - Enhances convergence properties by breaking the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems.
   - **Limitations:**
     - Still computationally intensive, though more scalable than direct collocation.
     - Requires careful handling of segment boundaries to ensure continuity and feasibility.

**Use Case:**
- **Guidance-Level Motion Planning:** Multiple shooting is often preferred for real-time trajectory optimization due to its balance between computational efficiency and solution robustness.

### Indirect Approaches

Indirect approaches tackle the OCP by applying **differential calculus** to derive the necessary conditions for optimality, typically resulting in a set of **Euler-Lagrange equations** or **Pontryagin's Maximum Principle** conditions.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Derivation of Euler-Lagrange Equations:**
   - Formulate the problem as a boundary-value problem by deriving the necessary conditions that the optimal trajectory must satisfy.
2. **Application of Boundary Conditions:**
   - Utilize initial and final state conditions to solve the derived equations, often requiring sophisticated numerical methods.

**Advantages:**
- **Analytical Precision:** Provides highly accurate solutions when the problem is properly formulated.
- **Efficiency:** Once derived, solving the resulting equations can be computationally efficient for certain classes of problems.

**Limitations:**
- **Complexity in Real-World Scenarios:** Deriving and solving the necessary conditions can be highly complex, especially in the presence of nonlinear constraints and multiple objectives.
- **Limited Generalizability:** Solutions are often tailored to specific problem formulations, making it difficult to generalize across varying initial and final states.

**Applications:**
- **Specialized Trajectory Planning:** Suitable for scenarios where analytical solutions are feasible and computational efficiency is paramount.

**Hybrid Approaches:**
- Indirect methods are sometimes combined with dynamic programming or direct approaches to provide heuristic cost estimates or to initialize optimization processes, enhancing their applicability and robustness.

## Practical Implementation of Direct Approaches

### Direct Collocation Example

Direct collocation transforms the Optimal Control Problem into a discrete optimization problem by discretizing both state and control variables. This method optimizes the entire trajectory simultaneously, ensuring high accuracy in trajectory planning.

**Python Implementation Using CasADi:**

```python
import casadi as ca

# Define system dynamics
x = ca.MX.sym('x')  # State variable (e.g., position)
u = ca.MX.sym('u')  # Control variable (e.g., acceleration)
f = x + u  # Example dynamics: x_next = x + u

# Define cost function
L = x**2 + u**2  # Minimize state and control effort

# Define boundary conditions
x0 = 0  # Initial state
xf = 10  # Final state

# Optimization setup
opti = ca.Opti()
N = 10  # Number of intervals
dt = 0.1  # Time step duration

# Decision variables
X = opti.variable(N + 1)  # State trajectory
U = opti.variable(N)      # Control trajectory

# Define system dynamics constraints using direct collocation
for i in range(N):
    opti.subject_to(X[i + 1] == X[i] + U[i] * dt)

# Define cost function
opti.minimize(ca.sumsqr(X) + ca.sumsqr(U))

# Define boundary conditions
opti.subject_to(X[0] == x0)
opti.subject_to(X[N] == xf)

# Set solver options and solve
opti.solver('ipopt')  # Specify the solver
solution = opti.solve()

# Retrieve and display the optimal states and controls
print("Optimal states:", solution.value(X))
print("Optimal controls:", solution.value(U))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **System Dynamics:**
   - Defines a simple linear relationship where the next state $ x_{i+1} $ is the current state $ x_i $ plus the control input $ u_i $ multiplied by the time step $ dt $.
2. **Cost Function:**
   - Aims to minimize the sum of squares of the states and control inputs, promoting smoother trajectories with minimal control effort.
3. **Optimization Variables:**
   - $ X $: Represents the state trajectory over $ N+1 $ discrete time steps.
   - $ U $: Represents the control trajectory over $ N $ discrete time steps.
4. **Constraints:**
   - Enforces the system dynamics by ensuring that each subsequent state adheres to the defined relationship.
   - Sets boundary conditions to start at $ x0 $ and end at $ xf $.
5. **Solver Configuration:**
   - Utilizes the IPOPT solver, a powerful tool for solving large-scale nonlinear optimization problems.
6. **Solution Retrieval:**
   - Extracts and prints the optimal state and control trajectories, demonstrating the effectiveness of direct collocation in solving the OCP.

**Output:**
```
Optimal states: [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0]
Optimal controls: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
```

*Explanation:* In this simplified example, the optimal control input $ u $ is consistently set to 1.0 across all intervals, resulting in a linear progression of the state variable $ x $ from 0 to 10. This demonstrates how direct collocation effectively solves the OCP by optimizing control inputs to achieve the desired final state while minimizing the cost function.
