## Potential Benefits of Automated Driving

### 1. Driving Safety
Road traffic accidents are a significant global issue:
- Fatalities: Approximately 1.3 million deaths annually due to traffic accidents.
- Injuries: 20 to 50 million non-fatal injuries occur yearly.
- Human Error: Over 90% of accidents are attributed to human mistakes such as distraction, fatigue, or limited situational awareness.

Automated driving systems can mitigate these issues by reducing the reliance on human intervention, enhancing road safety for all users.

### 2. Driving Comfort
Modern lifestyles demand multitasking, yet driving limits productivity:
- The average U.S. driver spends over 260 hours annually behind the wheel, often in monotonous conditions.
- Automation can alleviate the stress of congested traffic and allow drivers to engage in other activities, enhancing comfort and convenience.

### 3. Traffic Efficiency
Automated mobility promises a shift towards more efficient use of vehicles and infrastructure:
- Parking: Vehicles are parked 95% of the time.
- Occupancy: Average car occupancy is less than 1.6 persons.
- Shared and automated vehicles can reduce the need for parking spaces and optimize roadway capacity.

### 4. Environmental Impact
The transportation sector is a major contributor to CO2 emissions:
- Road Transport: Accounts for approximately 12% of global CO2 emissions.
- Automated driving can promote energy-efficient vehicle designs and shared mobility, leading to reduced emissions and energy consumption.

### 5. Accessibility
Automated driving offers mobility solutions for populations with limited driving capabilities:
- Non-drivers: Approximately 30% of Americans lack driverâ€™s licenses.
- Groups such as the elderly, children, and individuals with disabilities could benefit immensely from automated mobility.

## SAE Levels of Driving Automation
The SAE levels provide a framework for categorizing driving automation from Level 0 (no automation) to Level 5 (full automation). The progression reflects increasing autonomy and a diminishing role for human drivers in managing the dynamic driving task:

### Levels Overview
1. Level 0: No Automation
   - Features: Basic warnings and momentary assistance (e.g., lane departure warnings).

2. Level 1: Driver Assistance
   - Features: Either steering or acceleration/braking support, but not both simultaneously.

3. Level 2: Partial Automation
   - Features: Simultaneous steering and acceleration/braking assistance.
   - Responsibility: The driver must supervise and intervene as necessary.

4. Level 3: Conditional Automation
   - Features: The system manages all driving tasks under specific conditions but may request a human takeover when conditions exceed its operational design domain (ODD).

5. Level 4: High Automation
   - Features: Fully automated driving within a defined ODD. No driver intervention required in these scenarios.

6. Level 5: Full Automation
   - Features: Vehicles capable of handling all driving tasks under any conditions manageable by a human driver. Considered more a vision than a current reality.

- Developing robust V2X communication frameworks.

### Societal and Ethical Concerns
- Balancing privacy with connectivity.
- Addressing liability and regulatory ambiguities.

### Opportunities for Impact
Automated driving can redefine mobility by:
- Improving road safety.
- Optimizing transportation efficiency.
- Reducing environmental impact.
- Broadening mobility access to underserved populations.

## Quiz

- Which is not a potential benefit of automated driving?

    - Increased CO2 emissions (Automated driving aims to reduce CO2 emissions).

---

-   How many levels are there in the SAE Levels of Driving Automation?

    - 6 (The SAE defines 6 levels from Level 0 to Level 5).

---

- On which SAE level(s) is the person in the driver's seat allowed to keep their eyes off the road (completely or for short durations)?

    - Levels 3, 4, and 5 (At Level 3, the system may require the driver to take over, but monitoring is reduced, while Levels 4 and 5 do not require the driver's attention).
