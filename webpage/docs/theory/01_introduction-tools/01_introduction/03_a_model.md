# A-Model

The Automated and Connected Driving Challenges (ACDC) course is designed to provide comprehensive education on the methodologies and tools essential for understanding and advancing automated and connected vehicle systems. This documentation serves as a guide to understanding the course's structure, objectives, and key components such as the A-Model framework and the integration of the Robot Operating System (ROS).

## Introduction

The **A-Model** is a functional architecture used to structure automated driving functions, particularly in vehicles of **SAE Level 3 and higher**. It is named after its A-shaped structure, representing two "legs":

- **World Modeling (Left Side):** Sensor data flows upward to build a high-level understanding of the environment.
- **Planning and Actuation (Right Side):** High-level decisions are translated into low-level commands to control the vehicle.

The A-Model captures the essence of data flow, where functions are executed sequentially from sensing to actuation, and it allows for modular, scalable, and systematic development of automated driving systems.

## Core Components of the A-Model

### 1. World Modeling
World modeling involves building a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle’s environment and future states. It is divided into the following subcomponents:

#### a. **Sensor Data Processing**
- **Role:** Captures raw signals from the environment and vehicle (e.g., camera images, LiDAR point clouds).
- **Example:** Transform raw camera images into usable data such as object detections.

#### b. **Filtering and Tracking**
- **Role:** Processes raw data to form a coherent digital snapshot of the environment.
- **Example:** Detect objects and track their movement across frames, determining if an object is new or previously detected.

#### c. **Prediction**
- **Role:** Anticipates future states of the environment.
- **Short-Term Predictions:** Focus on immediate changes over several seconds.
- **Traffic Prediction:** Handles longer-term scenarios.

### 2. Planning and Actuation
Planning and actuation focus on translating decisions into actionable movements. This is further broken down into three steps:

#### a. **Navigation (Strategic Level)**
- **Role:** Plans the route from the current location to the destination.
- **Example:** Choosing a route to avoid traffic congestion.

#### b. **Guidance (Tactical Level)**
- **Role:** Plans maneuvers such as overtaking, yielding, or stopping at traffic lights.
- **Example:** Determining when to overtake a slower vehicle.

#### c. **Stabilization (Operative Level)**
- **Role:** Converts planned trajectories into actuator commands (e.g., steering, braking).
- **Example:** Translating a lane-change maneuver into specific throttle and steering inputs.

## Extensions to the A-Model

The A-Model is not limited to individual vehicles; it extends to cooperative and connected driving. Using **Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)** communication, vehicles can:

- **Cooperate:** Share data with other vehicles for collaborative planning.
- **Connect:** Interact with infrastructure elements, such as traffic lights.
- **Support:** Utilize cloud-based functions for collective decision-making.

These extensions enable enhanced safety, efficiency, and functionality.

## Time Horizons in the A-Model

The A-Model addresses varying time horizons:

- **Long-Term Planning:** Estimating routes and traffic conditions.
- **Short-Term Responses:** Reflexive actions (e.g., emergency braking) to handle unexpected situations.

This multi-level approach mirrors human driving, where both strategic thinking and reflexive responses are essential.

---

## Use of ROS in the A-Model

The **Robot Operating System (ROS)** serves as the middleware that connects the A-Model’s components. ROS facilitates:

- **Communication:** Ensures seamless data exchange between nodes.
- **Visualization:** Tools such as RQT and RViz enable debugging and monitoring.
- **Integration:** Modules like sensor processing, planning, and actuation are integrated into a cohesive stack.

In the context of the ACDC course, ROS represents the foundational "A" in the A-Model, binding the components together.
