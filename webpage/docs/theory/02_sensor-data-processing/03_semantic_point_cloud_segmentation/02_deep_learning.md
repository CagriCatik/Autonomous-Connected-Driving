# Deep Learning

Point cloud segmentation using deep learning is an innovative approach that harnesses neural networks to process complex, high-dimensional point cloud data. This documentation outlines the fundamental concepts, challenges, methodologies, and practical implementations of point cloud segmentation using deep learning techniques.

Point cloud segmentation involves partitioning a point cloud into meaningful segments, where each point is assigned a semantic label. This process is crucial for various applications, including automated vehicles, robotics, and augmented reality.

### Why Deep Learning?
Deep learning excels in handling the complex, high-dimensional nature of point clouds due to its ability to model non-linear relationships. Neural networks, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have proven effective in semantic segmentation tasks, offering significant advantages for point cloud processing:
- High accuracy with large-scale data.
- Capability to generalize complex patterns.
- Scalability with advancements in hardware.

## Point Cloud Representation

Point clouds consist of unstructured data: a list of points with spatial coordinates \((X, Y, Z)\) and additional attributes like reflection intensity and timestamp. Due to this lack of structure, raw point clouds are difficult to process efficiently using neural networks. Structured representations address this issue.

### Structured Representations
1. Range View Representation:
   - Projects the point cloud into a 2D image-like tensor.
   - Dimensions:
     - Height: Corresponds to the number of LiDAR rings.
     - Width: Corresponds to the field of view discretized with the LiDAR's horizontal resolution.
     - Channels: Attributes for each point, such as \((X, Y, Z)\), reflection intensity, and distance.
   - Benefits:
     - Leverages 2D CNNs for processing.
     - Efficient representation of sensor data.

2. Voxel Representation:
   - Discretizes the 3D space into bins (voxels) and stores occupancy states.
   - Limitation: Loss of fine-grained details due to discretization.

This documentation focuses on the range view representation due to its compatibility with convolutional neural networks.

## Datasets

### Semantic KITTI Dataset
- Captured with a Velodyne LiDAR sensor (64 layers, 10 Hz).
- Annotated with classes similar to the Cityscapes dataset.
- Challenges:
  - Point cloud characteristics vary with sensor configurations (e.g., layer count, frequency).
  - Domain shifts when using models trained on one sensor for another.

### Cross-Modal Label Transfer
Given the high cost of manually labeling point clouds:
- Semantic labels from images are transferred to point clouds.
- Steps:
  1. Project the point cloud onto the segmented image.
  2. Copy pixel labels to corresponding points.
- Limitations:
  - Labels are limited to the cameraâ€™s field of view.
  - Projection errors may introduce noise.

## Neural Network Architecture

The architecture for point cloud segmentation mirrors that of semantic image segmentation. A typical design employs an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections for better feature retention.

### Key Components
1. Input Representation:
   - Range view tensor of dimensions \([H, W, C]\), where \(H\) is the height, \(W\) is the width, and \(C\) includes attributes like \((X, Y, Z)\), intensity, and depth.

2. Output Representation:
   - Segmentation Map: Each pixel represents a class label.
   - Label Encodings:
     - Color Encoding: Visualization of classes using colors.
     - One-Hot Encoding: Facilitates softmax activation in the network's detection head.

3. Encoder-Decoder Structure:
   - Encoder: Extracts features through a series of convolutional layers.
   - Decoder: Reconstructs the segmentation map, using skip connections to combine high-level and low-level features.

---

## Data Preprocessing

Transforming raw point clouds into structured formats suitable for neural networks involves:
1. Cylindrical Projection:
   - Converts a point cloud into a 2D image-like tensor.
   - Attributes like distance and intensity are stored as channels.
2. Normalization:
   - Ensures uniform scaling of input values to improve training stability.

### Example: Range View Transformation
```python
import numpy as np

def cylindrical_projection(points, height, width):
    """
    Converts a point cloud into a cylindrical range view representation.
    Args:
        points (np.ndarray): Input point cloud with shape (N, 4) [X, Y, Z, intensity].
        height (int): Number of LiDAR rings.
        width (int): Horizontal resolution.
    Returns:
        range_view (np.ndarray): Cylindrical projection with shape (H, W, C).
    """
    range_view = np.zeros((height, width, 5))  # Channels: X, Y, Z, intensity, distance
    max_z = np.max(points[:, 2]) if np.max(points[:, 2]) != 0 else 1
    for point in points:
        x, y, z, intensity = point[:4]
        distance = np.sqrt(x2 + y2 + z2)
        # Map coordinates to range view indices
        row = int(height * (z / max_z))  # Normalize height
        angle = np.arctan2(y, x)
        angle = angle if angle >= 0 else (2 * np.pi + angle)
        col = int(width * (angle / (2 * np.pi)))  # Angle to width
        if row < height and col < width:
            range_view[row, col, :] = [x, y, z, intensity, distance]
    return range_view
```

## Training the Model

Training involves supervised learning with labeled datasets. Key steps:
1. Loss Function:
   - Categorical Cross-Entropy: Commonly used for multi-class segmentation.
   - Weighted Loss: Addresses class imbalance.
   
2. Optimization:
   - Optimizers like Adam with learning rate schedules.
   - Regularization techniques such as dropout to prevent overfitting.

3. Evaluation Metrics:
   - Intersection over Union (IoU): Measures overlap between predicted and ground truth segments.

## Example Implementation

### Model Definition
Using PyTorch, a simple encoder-decoder model with skip connections can be defined:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class PointCloudSegmenter(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(PointCloudSegmenter, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(5, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1),  # Input channels: X, Y, Z, intensity, distance
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(128, 256, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
        )
        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(256, 128, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1, output_padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(128, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1, output_padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(64, num_classes, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1, output_padding=1),
            nn.Softmax(dim=1),
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.encoder(x)
        x = self.decoder(x)
        return x
```

### Data Loader
To train the model, a data loader is necessary to feed the preprocessed range view tensors and corresponding labels into the network.

```python
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import torch

class PointCloudDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, point_clouds, labels, height, width, num_classes):
        """
        Args:
            point_clouds (list of np.ndarray): List of point clouds.
            labels (list of np.ndarray): List of label maps corresponding to point clouds.
            height (int): Height of the range view.
            width (int): Width of the range view.
            num_classes (int): Number of semantic classes.
        """
        self.point_clouds = point_clouds
        self.labels = labels
        self.height = height
        self.width = width
        self.num_classes = num_classes
    
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.point_clouds)
    
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        pc = self.point_clouds[idx]
        label = self.labels[idx]
        range_view = cylindrical_projection(pc, self.height, self.width)
        range_view = range_view.astype(np.float32)
        range_view = torch.from_numpy(range_view).permute(2, 0, 1)  # [C, H, W]
        
        label = torch.from_numpy(label).long()  # [H, W]
        return range_view, label

# Example usage:
# dataset = PointCloudDataset(point_clouds, labels, height=64, width=1024, num_classes=20)
# dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=16, shuffle=True, num_workers=4)
```

### Training Loop
The training loop handles the forward and backward passes, loss computation, and optimization.

```python
import torch.optim as optim
from tqdm import tqdm

def train_model(model, dataloader, criterion, optimizer, device, num_epochs=25):
    model.to(device)
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        model.train()
        running_loss = 0.0
        for inputs, labels in tqdm(dataloader, desc=f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}"):
            inputs = inputs.to(device)  # [B, C, H, W]
            labels = labels.to(device)  # [B, H, W]
            
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            
            outputs = model(inputs)  # [B, num_classes, H, W]
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            
            running_loss += loss.item() * inputs.size(0)
        
        epoch_loss = running_loss / len(dataloader.dataset)
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Loss: {epoch_loss:.4f}")
    print("Training complete.")
```

### Evaluation
Evaluating the model using Intersection over Union (IoU) to assess segmentation performance.

```python
def evaluate_model(model, dataloader, num_classes, device):
    model.eval()
    iou_per_class = np.zeros(num_classes)
    count_per_class = np.zeros(num_classes)
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        for inputs, labels in tqdm(dataloader, desc="Evaluating"):
            inputs = inputs.to(device)
            labels = labels.to(device)
            
            outputs = model(inputs)  # [B, num_classes, H, W]
            preds = torch.argmax(outputs, dim=1)  # [B, H, W]
            
            for cls in range(num_classes):
                intersection = ((preds == cls) & (labels == cls)).sum().item()
                union = ((preds == cls) | (labels == cls)).sum().item()
                if union > 0:
                    iou_per_class[cls] += intersection / union
                    count_per_class[cls] += 1
    
    mean_iou = np.sum(iou_per_class) / np.sum(count_per_class)
    print(f"Mean IoU: {mean_iou:.4f}")
    for cls in range(num_classes):
        if count_per_class[cls] > 0:
            print(f"Class {cls}: IoU = {iou_per_class[cls] / count_per_class[cls]:.4f}")
    return mean_iou
```

### Putting It All Together
Here is how you can integrate the components to train and evaluate the model.

```python
# Assuming you have loaded your point_clouds and labels lists
height = 64
width = 1024
num_classes = 20
batch_size = 16
num_epochs = 25
learning_rate = 1e-3

# Initialize dataset and dataloaders
dataset = PointCloudDataset(point_clouds, labels, height, width, num_classes)
train_size = int(0.8 * len(dataset))
val_size = len(dataset) - train_size
train_dataset, val_dataset = torch.utils.data.random_split(dataset, [train_size, val_size])

train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True, num_workers=4)
val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False, num_workers=4)

# Initialize model, loss function, optimizer
model = PointCloudSegmenter(num_classes=num_classes)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(ignore_index=255)  # Assuming 255 is the ignore label
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Training
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
train_model(model, train_loader, criterion, optimizer, device, num_epochs=num_epochs)

# Evaluation
mean_iou = evaluate_model(model, val_loader, num_classes, device)
```

    # Rotation around the Z-axis
    theta = np.random.uniform(0, 2 * np.pi)
    rotation_matrix = np.array([
        [np.cos(theta), -np.sin(theta), 0],
        [np.sin(theta),  np.cos(theta), 0],
        [0,             0,             1]
    ])
    points[:, :3] = points[:, :3].dot(rotation_matrix)
    
    # Scaling
    scale = np.random.uniform(0.95, 1.05)
    points[:, :3] *= scale
    
    # Translation
    translation = np.random.uniform(-0.5, 0.5, size=(3,))
    points[:, :3] += translation
    
    return points
```
