- **Advantages**:
  - **Ease of Implementation**: The mathematical framework of the Kalman Filter is well-established, making it relatively straightforward to implement for linear systems.
  - **Computational Efficiency**: Optimized for real-time applications, the Kalman Filter requires minimal computational resources, facilitating its use in resource-constrained environments.

- **Variants**:
  - **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)**: Extends the Kalman Filter to handle nonlinear systems by linearizing around the current estimate.
  - **Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)**: Utilizes a deterministic sampling approach to better capture the mean and covariance estimates in nonlinear transformations.

- **Code Example**:
    ```python
    import numpy as np

    # Define the state transition and measurement functions
    def state_transition(state):
        # Example: simple constant velocity model
        dt = 1.0  # time step
        F = np.array([[1, dt],
                      [0, 1]])
        return F @ state

    def measurement_function(state):
        # Example: measuring position only
        H = np.array([[1, 0]])
        return H @ state

    # Kalman Filter Initialization
    state_estimate = np.array([0, 1])  # Initial state [position, velocity]
    covariance_matrix = np.eye(2)       # Initial covariance matrix
    measurement_noise = 0.1             # Measurement noise variance
    process_noise = np.eye(2) * 0.01    # Process noise covariance

    # Simulated measurement
    measurement = np.array([1.2])

    # Prediction Step
    state_prediction = state_transition(state_estimate)
    F = np.array([[1, 1],
                  [0, 1]])
    covariance_prediction = F @ covariance_matrix @ F.T + process_noise

    # Update Step
    H = np.array([[1, 0]])
    S = H @ covariance_prediction @ H.T + measurement_noise
    kalman_gain = covariance_prediction @ H.T @ np.linalg.inv(S)
    state_estimate = state_prediction + kalman_gain @ (measurement - measurement_function(state_prediction))
    covariance_matrix = (np.eye(len(state_estimate)) - kalman_gain @ H) @ covariance_prediction

    print("Updated State Estimate:", state_estimate)
    print("Updated Covariance Matrix:\n", covariance_matrix)
    ```

    **Explanation**:
    - **State Vector**: Represents the vehicle's position and velocity.
    - **Prediction Step**: Projects the current state estimate forward using the state transition model.
    - **Update Step**: Incorporates the new measurement to refine the state estimate, adjusting for the uncertainty captured in the covariance matrices.

### **2. Particle Filter**

- **Description**: The Particle Filter is a sequential Monte Carlo method that represents the probability distribution of possible states using a set of discrete particles. Each particle embodies a potential state of the system, and the ensemble of particles approximates the underlying distribution.

- **Advantages**:
  - **Nonlinear and Non-Gaussian Handling**: Effectively manages systems with nonlinear dynamics and non-Gaussian noise distributions, which are common in real-world localization scenarios.
  - **Probability Distribution Maintenance**: Preserves a full representation of the state uncertainty, enabling more nuanced pose estimation.

- **Steps**:
  1. **Initialization**: Generate a set of particles with random states based on prior knowledge or uniform distribution.
  2. **Prediction**: Propagate each particle through the state transition model to predict the next state.
  3. **Weighting**: Assign weights to particles based on the likelihood of the observed measurements given the particle states.
  4. **Resampling**: Select particles based on their weights to form a new set, emphasizing particles with higher likelihoods and discarding those with negligible weights.
  5. **Estimation**: Compute the weighted average of the particles to derive the final state estimate.

- **Code Example**:
    ```python
    import numpy as np

    def measurement_likelihood(particle, measurement):
        # Example: Gaussian likelihood based on distance to measurement
        distance = np.linalg.norm(particle[:1] - measurement)
        return np.exp(-distance**2 / (2 * 0.1**2))

    # Initialize particles and weights
    num_particles = 100
    particles = np.random.rand(num_particles, 2)  # 100 particles in 2D space [position, velocity]
    weights = np.ones(num_particles) / num_particles  # Equal weights initially

    # Simulated measurement
    measurement = np.array([1.2])

    # Prediction Step: Simple constant velocity model
    dt = 1.0
    for i in range(num_particles):
        particles[i][0] += particles[i][1] * dt  # Update position based on velocity

    # Update weights based on measurement likelihood
    for i in range(num_particles):
        weights[i] *= measurement_likelihood(particles[i], measurement)

    # Normalize weights
    weights += 1.e-300  # Avoid division by zero
    weights /= np.sum(weights)

    # Resample particles based on weights
    cumulative_sum = np.cumsum(weights)
    cumulative_sum[-1] = 1.0  # Ensure sum is exactly one
    indexes = np.searchsorted(cumulative_sum, np.random.rand(num_particles))

    particles = particles[indexes]
    weights.fill(1.0 / num_particles)

    # Estimate state as the mean of the particles
    estimated_state = np.mean(particles, axis=0)
    print("Estimated State:", estimated_state)
    ```

    **Explanation**:
    - **Particle Representation**: Each particle represents a possible state of the vehicle, characterized by position and velocity.
    - **Measurement Likelihood**: Determines how probable a particle's state is given the observed measurement, guiding the weighting process.
    - **Resampling**: Focuses computational resources on the most promising particles, enhancing estimation accuracy over time.

### **3. Graph-Based Fusion**

- **Code Example**:
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import networkx as nx
    from scipy.optimize import least_squares

    # Create a pose graph using NetworkX
    pose_graph = nx.Graph()

    # Add nodes with initial pose estimates
    pose_graph.add_node(0, pose=np.array([0, 0, 0]))  # Node 0: [x, y, theta]
    pose_graph.add_node(1, pose=np.array([1, 0, 0.1]))
    pose_graph.add_node(2, pose=np.array([2, 0, 0.2]))
    # Add more nodes as needed

    # Add edges with relative pose constraints
    pose_graph.add_edge(0, 1, relative_pose=np.array([1, 0, 0.1]))
    pose_graph.add_edge(1, 2, relative_pose=np.array([1, 0, 0.1]))
    # Add more edges as needed

    # Define the optimization function
    def optimize_poses(pose_graph):
        # Extract poses
        nodes = list(pose_graph.nodes)
        poses = np.array([pose_graph.nodes[n]['pose'] for n in nodes])

        def residuals(params):
            residual = []
            for edge in pose_graph.edges(data=True):
                i, j, data = edge
                relative_pose = data['relative_pose']
                xi, yi, thetai = params[3*i:3*i+3]
                xj, yj, thetaj = params[3*j:3*j+3]
                
                # Predicted relative pose based on current estimates
                dx = xj - xi
                dy = yj - yi
                dtheta = thetaj - thetai

                # Compute residuals
                residual.append(dx - relative_pose[0])
                residual.append(dy - relative_pose[1])
                residual.append(dtheta - relative_pose[2])
            return residual

        # Initial parameter vector
        x0 = poses.flatten()

        # Perform optimization
        result = least_squares(residuals, x0)

        # Update poses in the graph
        optimized_poses = result.x.reshape(-1, 3)
        for idx, n in enumerate(nodes):
            pose_graph.nodes[n]['pose'] = optimized_poses[idx]

    # Optimize the pose graph
    optimize_poses(pose_graph)

    # Print optimized poses
    for n in pose_graph.nodes:
        print(f"Node {n} Optimized Pose: {pose_graph.nodes[n]['pose']}")
    ```

    **Explanation**:
    - **Pose Representation**: Each node in the graph represents the vehicle's pose at a specific time, characterized by its position (x, y) and orientation (theta).
    - **Relative Pose Constraints**: Edges between nodes encode the expected relative transformation between consecutive poses, derived from sensor measurements.
    - **Optimization Process**: The `least_squares` function minimizes the residuals between the predicted relative poses and the measured constraints, resulting in optimized pose estimates that best fit the observed data.
