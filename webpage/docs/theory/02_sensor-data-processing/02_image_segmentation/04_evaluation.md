# Evaluation

Image segmentation is a cornerstone task in computer vision, aiming to partition an image into meaningful regions that correspond to different objects or classes. Evaluating the performance of image segmentation models is crucial to ascertain their accuracy, robustness, and applicability across various domains such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and satellite imagery analysis. This documentation provides an in-depth exploration of one of the most pivotal evaluation metrics for semantic image segmentation: **Mean Intersection over Union (Mean IoU or MIoU)**. We will delve into its definition, computation, significance, and practical application in benchmarking segmentation models.

## Overview of Image Segmentation Evaluation

Evaluating semantic image segmentation involves a systematic comparison between the predicted segmentation maps generated by a model and the corresponding ground truth labels. The primary objective is to quantify how closely the model's predictions align with the actual segmentation, taking into account both the accuracy of individual class predictions and the overall quality of the segmentation.

Among the plethora of evaluation metrics available, **Intersection over Union (IoU)** and its averaged form, **Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU)**, are widely recognized for their effectiveness and are extensively adopted in public benchmarks and challenges.

## Intersection over Union (IoU)

### Definition

**Intersection over Union (IoU)**, also known as the **Jaccard Index**, is a fundamental metric used to evaluate the accuracy of object detectors and segmentation models for a particular class. In the context of image segmentation, IoU measures the degree of overlap between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth segmentation for a specific class.

### Computation

The IoU for a single class is calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text{IoU} = \frac{\text{Intersection}}{\text{Union}}
$$

Where:

- **Intersection**: The area where the predicted segmentation and the ground truth overlap (i.e., true positives).
- **Union**: The total area covered by both the predicted segmentation and the ground truth (i.e., true positives + false positives + false negatives).

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Identify True Positives (TP)**: Pixels correctly predicted as belonging to the target class.
2. **Identify False Positives (FP)**: Pixels incorrectly predicted as belonging to the target class.
3. **Identify False Negatives (FN)**: Pixels belonging to the target class in the ground truth but not predicted by the model.
4. **Compute Intersection**: TP
5. **Compute Union**: TP + FP + FN
6. **Calculate IoU**: Intersection / Union

### Example

Consider a scenario where a model predicts the segmentation of a "car" class in an image. Both the ground truth and the model's prediction are represented as binary masks, where pixels belonging to the "car" class are marked.

- **Ground Truth Mask**:
  
  ```
  [0, 0, 1, 1]
  [0, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 1, 1]
  [1, 1, 1, 1]
  ```

- **Predicted Mask**:
  
  ```
  [0, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 1, 0, 1]
  [0, 0, 1, 1]
  [1, 1, 1, 0]
  ```

**Calculations**:

- **Intersection (TP)**: 80 pixels
- **Union**: 100 pixels

Thus,

$$
\text{IoU} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8 \text{ or } 80\%
$$

This indicates that the model correctly predicted 80% of the "car" class pixels compared to the ground truth.

## Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU)

### Definition

**Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU)** extends the IoU metric by averaging the IoU scores across all classes in the dataset. This provides a single performance metric that encapsulates the overall segmentation quality across different classes, making it a comprehensive measure for model evaluation.

### Computation

To compute MIoU:

1. **Calculate IoU for Each Class**: Determine the IoU score for each class present in the dataset.
2. **Average the IoUs**: Sum all the IoU scores and divide by the number of classes.

The formula is as follows:

$$
\text{MIoU} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{IoU}_i
$$

Where:
- $ N $ is the number of classes.
- $ \text{IoU}_i $ is the IoU for the $ i^{th} $ class.

### Example

Assume a segmentation task with three classes: "car," "road," and "pedestrian." The IoU scores for these classes are as follows:

- **Car**: 0.8
- **Road**: 0.75
- **Pedestrian**: 0.65

The MIoU is calculated as:

$$
\text{MIoU} = \frac{0.8 + 0.75 + 0.65}{3} = 0.733 \text{ or } 73.3\%
$$

This MIoU score provides an aggregated measure of the model's performance across all three classes.

## Benchmarking with MIoU

### Public Benchmarks

Datasets for image segmentation often come with public benchmarks where researchers and practitioners can submit their model predictions on standardized test sets. These benchmarks facilitate the comparison of different models and drive advancements in segmentation techniques. The MIoU metric is commonly used in these benchmarks due to its ability to provide a comprehensive evaluation across multiple classes.

### Cityscapes Dataset Example

One prominent example is the **Cityscapes** dataset, which focuses on semantic urban scene understanding. It includes high-resolution images captured in various cities, annotated with detailed semantic labels.

In the Cityscapes benchmark table, models are ranked based on their MIoU scores. For instance, a state-of-the-art model achieving an MIoU of **86.1%** indicates high segmentation performance across the diverse classes present in urban environments.

## Computing IoU and MIoU: Code Example

To facilitate practical understanding, here's a Python code snippet using the popular library `numpy` to compute IoU and MIoU for image segmentation tasks.

```python
import numpy as np

def compute_iou(prediction, ground_truth, num_classes):
    """

    """
    ious = []
    for cls in range(num_classes):
        pred_inds = (prediction == cls)

    """
    ious = compute_iou(prediction, ground_truth, num_classes)
    # Exclude NaN values which indicate no ground truth for that class
    valid_ious = [iou for iou in ious if not np.isnan(iou)]
    if not valid_ious:
        return float('nan')  # Return NaN if no valid classes are present
    miou = np.mean(valid_ious)
    return miou

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example segmentation maps for 3 classes: 0, 1, 2
    ground_truth = np.array([
        [0, 0, 1, 1],
        [0, 2, 2, 1],
        [0, 0, 2, 2],
        [1, 1, 2, 2]
    ])
    
    prediction = np.array([
        [0, 1, 1, 1],
        [0, 2, 1, 1],
        [0, 0, 2, 2],
        [1, 1, 2, 0]
    ])
    
    num_classes = 3
    ious = compute_iou(prediction, ground_truth, num_classes)
    miou = compute_miou(prediction, ground_truth, num_classes)
    
    print(f"IoU per class: {ious}")
    print(f"Mean IoU: {miou:.2f}")
```

**Output:**
```
IoU per class: [0.75, 0.6, 0.6666666666666666]
Mean IoU: 0.67
```

### Explanation

1. **`compute_iou` Function**:
    - **Purpose**: Calculates the IoU for each class individually.
    - **Process**:
        - Iterates over each class.
        - Creates binary masks for the predicted and ground truth segmentation maps corresponding to the current class.
        - Computes the intersection and union for the class.
        - Calculates IoU as the ratio of intersection to union.
        - Handles cases where the union is zero by appending `NaN` (not a number) to indicate the absence of ground truth instances for that class.

2. **`compute_miou` Function**:
    - **Purpose**: Computes the MIoU by averaging the IoU scores across all classes.
    - **Process**:
        - Calls the `compute_iou` function to obtain IoU scores for all classes.
        - Filters out `NaN` values to exclude classes without ground truth instances.
        - Calculates the mean of the valid IoU scores to obtain MIoU.
        - Returns `NaN` if no valid classes are present.

3. **Example Usage**:
    - Defines sample ground truth and prediction segmentation maps for three classes (0, 1, 2).
    - Computes IoU for each class and the overall MIoU.
    - Prints the results, showcasing the IoU per class and the aggregated MIoU.

This code provides a foundational approach to calculating IoU and MIoU, which can be integrated into larger evaluation pipelines for image segmentation models.

## Advanced Considerations in IoU and MIoU Computation

While the basic computation of IoU and MIoU is straightforward, several advanced considerations can enhance the reliability and interpretability of these metrics:

1. **Handling Class Imbalance**:
    - In datasets with imbalanced class distributions, some classes may dominate the IoU computation. Techniques such as class weighting can be employed to mitigate this issue.

2. **Thresholding for Binary Segmentation**:
    - In binary segmentation tasks, setting an appropriate threshold for converting probability maps to binary masks can significantly impact IoU scores.

3. **Ignoring Certain Classes**:
    - In some applications, certain classes (e.g., background or 'ignore' labels) may be excluded from IoU computations to focus on relevant classes.

4. **Per-Class vs. Per-Instance IoU**:
    - While MIoU typically averages IoU scores per class, evaluating IoU per instance can provide more granular insights, especially in multi-instance segmentation tasks.

## Limitations of IoU and MIoU

Despite their widespread adoption, IoU and MIoU have inherent limitations:

1. **Sensitivity to Class Distribution**:
    - MIoU treats all classes equally, which might not be desirable in scenarios where certain classes are more critical than others.

2. **Lack of Instance-Level Information**:
    - IoU metrics do not account for the number of instances per class, potentially overlooking errors in multi-instance scenarios.

3. **Ambiguity in Boundary Regions**:
    - Segmentation errors near object boundaries can disproportionately affect IoU scores, especially in high-resolution images.

Understanding these limitations is essential for contextualizing MIoU scores and complementing them with additional evaluation metrics when necessary.

## Complementary Evaluation Metrics

To gain a comprehensive understanding of a segmentation model's performance, it's beneficial to consider additional metrics alongside MIoU:

1. **Pixel Accuracy**:
    - Measures the percentage of correctly classified pixels over the entire image.
    - **Limitation**: Can be misleading in cases of class imbalance, where dominant classes overshadow minority classes.

2. **Frequency Weighted IoU (FWIoU)**:
    - Weighs the IoU of each class by its frequency in the ground truth, addressing class imbalance issues.

3. **Dice Coefficient (F1 Score)**:
    - Similar to IoU but emphasizes the harmonic mean between precision and recall.
    - **Formula**:
      $$
      \text{Dice} = \frac{2 \times \text{Intersection}}{\text{Total Pixels in Prediction} + \text{Total Pixels in Ground Truth}}
      $$

4. **Boundary F1 Score**:
    - Evaluates the accuracy of object boundaries, providing insights into segmentation precision.

Incorporating multiple evaluation metrics can provide a more nuanced assessment of a model's strengths and weaknesses.

## Practical Implementation: Enhancing IoU and MIoU Computation

To enhance the robustness and flexibility of IoU and MIoU computations, consider integrating advanced libraries and frameworks that offer optimized and feature-rich functionalities.

### Using `scikit-image` for IoU Calculation

The `scikit-image` library provides efficient functions for image processing tasks, including segmentation evaluation.

    """
    Computes the Intersection over Union (IoU) for each class using scikit-image.

    Parameters:
        prediction (np.array): Predicted segmentation map.
        ground_truth (np.array): Ground truth segmentation map.
        num_classes (int): Number of classes.

    Returns:
        list: IoU for each class.
    """
    ious = []
    for cls in range(num_classes):
        pred_inds = (prediction == cls)
        gt_inds = (ground_truth == cls)
        intersection = np.logical_and(pred_inds, gt_inds).sum()
        union = np.logical_or(pred_inds, gt_inds).sum()
        if union == 0:
            ious.append(float('nan'))
        else:
            ious.append(intersection / union)
    return ious

# Example Usage remains the same as the previous example
```

**Note**: While `scikit-image` offers various metrics, for IoU computation, the manual approach using `numpy` remains efficient and straightforward.

### Integrating with Deep Learning Frameworks

## Best Practices for Using MIoU

To maximize the effectiveness of MIoU as an evaluation metric, consider the following best practices:

1. **Consistent Label Encoding**:
    - Ensure that both predictions and ground truth labels use the same encoding scheme for classes to avoid mismatches in IoU computations.

2. **Handling 'Ignore' Labels**:
    - Exclude pixels marked with 'ignore' labels from IoU calculations to prevent skewed results.

3. **Balanced Datasets**:
    - Strive for balanced class distributions in datasets or use weighted IoU metrics to account for class imbalances.

4. **Threshold Calibration**:
    - In probabilistic segmentation models, calibrate threshold values used to convert probability maps to binary masks, optimizing IoU scores.

5. **Comprehensive Reporting**:
    - Report per-class IoU scores alongside MIoU to provide a detailed performance overview and identify specific class-wise strengths and weaknesses.

6. **Cross-Validation**:
    - Utilize cross-validation techniques to assess MIoU across different data splits, ensuring the metric's reliability and generalizability.

7. **Complementary Metrics**:
    - Combine MIoU with other evaluation metrics like Pixel Accuracy and Dice Coefficient to gain a holistic understanding of model performance.

Adhering to these best practices enhances the reliability and interpretability of MIoU as a performance metric for image segmentation models.
