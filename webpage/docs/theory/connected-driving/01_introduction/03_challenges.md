Systems must be capable of handling offline scenarios gracefully, ensuring safety and functionality without constant connectivity.

- **Data Integrity**: The handling of faulty or malicious external data is critical to prevent system malfunctions or security breaches. Robust mechanisms must be in place to validate and sanitize incoming data, ensuring that only accurate and trustworthy information influences vehicle behavior. This involves implementing advanced error-checking algorithms, intrusion detection systems, and data authentication protocols to maintain the integrity of the data being processed.

### Mixed Traffic Scenarios

The coexistence of connected, non-connected, automated, and non-automated agents complicates traffic management dynamics:

- **Collective Planning and Cooperation**: Automated systems must adeptly navigate environments where not all agents are part of the connected ecosystem. Developing adaptive algorithms capable of interpreting and responding to the unpredictable behaviors of non-connected and non-automated vehicles, pedestrians, and other road users is essential. This involves creating flexible models that can handle a wide range of interactions and scenarios, ensuring safe and efficient traffic flow despite the presence of diverse agents.

### Privacy and Compliance

Balancing data sharing with privacy protection is a delicate endeavor in connected driving systems:

- **Regulatory Adherence**: Data exchanged between vehicles and infrastructure must comply with stringent privacy protection and anti-discrimination regulations. This ensures that personal and sensitive information is safeguarded against unauthorized access and misuse. Adhering to varying regional and international regulations adds complexity to data management practices, requiring robust compliance frameworks and continuous monitoring.

- **Risk of Data Misuse**: The potential for identifiable data to be exploited poses significant ethical and legal risks. Implementing robust data anonymization and access control measures is essential to mitigate the chances of discrimination and ensure equitable treatment of all users. This includes adopting best practices for data minimization, encryption, and secure storage to protect user privacy while enabling the necessary data sharing for system functionality.

### Responsibility Attribution

Determining accountability in the event of system failures is inherently complex:

- **Multiple Entities Involvement**: Connected driving systems often involve various stakeholders, including manufacturers, software developers, infrastructure providers, and service operators. Assigning responsibility when failures occur requires clear delineation of roles and responsibilities. Establishing comprehensive agreements and standards for accountability is crucial to ensure that all parties understand their obligations and can be held responsible appropriately.

- **Imperfect Data**: Inaccurate or incomplete data can obscure the root causes of failures, complicating legal and operational accountability. Establishing transparent and comprehensive data logging mechanisms is necessary to facilitate accurate fault diagnosis and responsibility assignment. Detailed logs and forensic analysis capabilities are essential for tracing the origins of issues and determining liability.
