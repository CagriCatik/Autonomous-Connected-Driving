## Key Aspects of Connected Driving

### 1. Relation to the A-Model
- Integration with A-Model: Connected driving is embedded within the A-Model, a simplified functional architecture for automated vehicles. It enhances the architecture by:
  - Providing additional inputs from external sources.
  - Receiving outputs to improve decision-making.
  - Replacing traditional vehicle functions with more intelligent, connected solutions.
- Visualization: These connections are often depicted with wireless symbols, emphasizing the reliance on communication technologies.

### 2. Goals of Connected Driving
- Support for Various Road Users:
  - Includes automated vehicles (e.g., delivery robots).
  - Accommodates human road users, such as pedestrians equipped with smartphones.
  - Integrates traffic infrastructure elements, such as smart traffic lights and sensors.
- Enhanced Mobility System Management:
  - Optimizes traffic control infrastructure (e.g., traffic lights, digital speed signs).
  - Balances local (edge servers) and remote (cloud) computing for optimal functionality.

### 3. Functional Categorization
Connected driving functions are categorized to address general and specific challenges, including:
- Navigation Integration:
  - Routes computed in the cloud incorporate external data (e.g., weather, traffic conditions).
  - Enables dynamic re-routing and predictive navigation.
- Perception Data Sharing:
  - Vehicles exchange real-time data to address occlusions and blind spots.
  - Enhances environment modeling for autonomous systems, ensuring safer decisions.

### 4. Terminology Overview
A foundational understanding of key terms is essential:
- V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure): Communication between vehicles and infrastructure elements like traffic lights.
- V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything): Broader communication, encompassing vehicles, infrastructure, pedestrians, and more.

## Learning Tasks

To ensure comprehensive understanding, the module includes:

1. Coding Assignments:
   - Implement connected driving functionalities using frameworks like ROS (Robot Operating System).
   - Example: Setting up V2X communication between a vehicle and a simulated traffic light.

   ```python
   import rospy
   from std_msgs.msg import String

   def v2x_communication():
       rospy.init_node('v2x_node', anonymous=True)
       pub = rospy.Publisher('traffic_signal', String, queue_size=10)
       rate = rospy.Rate(10) # 10 Hz

       while not rospy.is_shutdown():
           traffic_status = "Green Light"
           rospy.loginfo(traffic_status)
           pub.publish(traffic_status)
           rate.sleep()

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       try:
           v2x_communication()
       except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
           pass
   ```

2. Quizzes:
   - Reinforce conceptual understanding with self-check quizzes.
   - Example Question: *What is the primary advantage of V2X communication over traditional vehicle functions?*
