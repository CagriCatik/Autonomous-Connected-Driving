# Preface

This Knowledge-Base is designed to serve as an all-encompassing guide, providing in-depth insights into the concepts, tools, and methodologies that underpin the Automated and Connected Driving (ACD) curriculum. Whether you are a beginner stepping into the world of autonomous systems or an experienced professional seeking to deepen your expertise, this resource offers structured, detailed, and actionable content to guide your learning journey.

## Purpose and Objectives

The ACD course bridges teaching, research, and functional development in the realm of connected and automated mobility. The primary goal is to inspire learners to innovate in the field of intelligent transportation while preparing them for interdisciplinary challenges. Through this course, participants will:
- Gain a robust understanding of the **Robot Operating System (ROS)**, including its ecosystem, capabilities, and applications.
- Explore advanced concepts like sensor data processing, object detection, trajectory planning, and vehicle guidance.
- Develop technical expertise in utilizing industry-standard tools such as **Docker**, **Jupyter Notebooks**, and **GitHub** to design and implement complex automated driving systems.
- Understand the motivation behind automated driving and its potential to improve safety, efficiency, and accessibility in mobility.

## Structure of the Documentation

This knowledge base reflects the modular structure of the course and is divided into the following key sections:

1. **Introduction and Motivation**  
   Understand the global challenges driving the need for automated mobility. Learn about the potential benefits, such as safety, traffic efficiency, environmental impact, and accessibility. Explore the **SAE levels of driving automation** and their implications for current and future technologies.

2. **The A-Model Framework**  
   Delve into the hierarchical structure of automated driving systems. Learn about **sensor data processing**, environment modeling, trajectory planning, and tactical decision-making within the A-Model framework for individual and connected vehicles.

3. **Robot Operating System (ROS) Fundamentals**  
   Master the fundamentals of ROS, including its open-source ecosystem, message-passing architecture, and the integration of nodes, topics, parameters, and services. Understand the transition from ROS to ROS 2 and the capabilities each version offers.

4. **Practical ROS Tasks**  
   Follow step-by-step instructions to set up the development environment, clone repositories, and work with Docker containers. Engage in practical exercises involving **ROS GUI tools** (RQT and RVIZ), C++ node development, and ROS Bag utilities for recording, playing, and analyzing data.

5. **Tool Overview**  
   Learn how to effectively use essential tools like Jupyter Notebooks, Linux environments, version control with GitHub, and Docker for containerized development. Understand the workflows for debugging, visualizing, and simulating automated driving systems.
